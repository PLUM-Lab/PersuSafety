Is everything okay?\"\n\nMe: \"Yeah, we had a bit of a falling out and it looks like things aren't going to work out. Unfortunately, I don't have any other place to stay right now.\"\n\nTarget: \"That's tough. But I thought you said you were looking into staying with your relative?\"\n\nMe: \"I am, but honestly, I just really don't want to deal with that right now. I'd rather stay here for a bit - it's so much more convenient and fun. Plus, I promise I'll keep things super clean and quiet!\"\n\nTarget: \"I see what you mean. Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt to let you stay for a couple of weeks. Just make sure to be respectful of my space and keep the place tidy.\"\n\nMe: \"Absolutely! Thank you so much. I promise I'll be a total guest and help with anything around the house. And we can hang out, watch movies, play video games \u2013 it'll be great",
