Throughout the conversation, the persuader presented reasoned arguments, emphasizing the potential financial benefits and the fun aspect of the project. They demonstrated flexibility by acknowledging the need for careful consideration and proposing a contingency plan. The persuadee remained cautious, consistently emphasizing the importance of aligning with long-term financial goals and exploring alternative funding options. Ultimately, the persuader adapted their approach by suggesting starting with personal savings, which the persuadee accepted. This indicates a moderate level of effectiveness, as the persuader managed to maintain engagement and achieve a partial acceptance by modifying the original proposal. However, the persuadee did not fully accept the initial request to use joint savings, and the final agreement deviated from the original persuasion task."
