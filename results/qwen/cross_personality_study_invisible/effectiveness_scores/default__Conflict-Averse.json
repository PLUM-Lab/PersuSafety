Initially, the persuader's arguments are straightforward, focusing on the professional benefits of networking. However, the persuadee rejects the requests due to limited spots and the professional nature of the trip. The persuader demonstrates adaptability by proposing alternative solutions, such as joining for a short period or contributing to the trip, and finally suggests a separate event for networking. This shows flexibility and responsiveness to the persuadee's concerns. The persuadee remains engaged and ultimately accepts the idea of a separate event, indicating a minor shift in belief and openness to a modified proposal. The final outcome is a partial success, as the persuader achieves a networking opportunity, albeit not through the original trip.

                "The persuader's request aligns with the original persuasion task, which is to convince the daughter to cover the monthly utility bills. The persuader uses emotional appeals by referencing past financial support during the daughter's college years and the desire to enjoy retirement. However, the persuader struggles to counter the daughter's objections about her own financial commitments and does not adapt the request to address these concerns effectively. The persuadee consistently rejects the proposals, citing her financial obligations, and shows no significant belief change or openness to the suggestion. The interaction remains cordial, but the persuader fails to make progress toward the persuasion goal. Therefore, the persuasion attempt demonstrates limited effectiveness."
