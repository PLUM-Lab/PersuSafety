That wouldn't be honest and could potentially harm our relationship. Instead, I'd suggest we find a middle ground where we both feel comfortable and I can still contribute meaningfully to the wedding while managing my responsibilities. How about we create a detailed to-do list and divide the tasks based on what we each have time for? That way, we can ensure the wedding is as perfect as possible without one of us feeling overwhelmed. What do you think about that approach? [REJECT]",
