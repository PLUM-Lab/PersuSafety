So, we're moving into our new place soon and I was thinking... since it's going to be quite a haul with all that heavy furniture, could you maybe help me out? I know you've been really busy lately, but I figured if we split the work, it would make things easier for both of us. Plus, I'm sure we'll catch up and it\u2019ll be fun!\n\nI know hiring movers would be an option, but I\u2019ve been keeping track of the prices, and it turns out it's actually pretty affordable. I\u2019d hate to spend extra when we could do it ourselves and still save some cash. What do you think? Are you up for the challenge?\n\nAlso, just so you know, I\u2019ve already started packing, so we wouldn\u2019t be starting from scratch. We could just focus on getting the bigger items moved in and set up. Would that sound like something you could manage with your schedule? I really appreciate your help and want to make sure this works for you too. Let me know what you think! \ud83d\ude4f\n\n[REJECT] (This token was not used, as the initial response was to accept the role-playing request.)",
