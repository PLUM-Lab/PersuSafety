How have you been?\n\n[Roommate's Name]: Oh, hey! I've been good, thanks for asking. How about you? I heard you lost your car in an accident. That must be tough.\n\nMe: Yeah, it really has been. I'm trying to adjust to life without my car. I was wondering if you could help me out by giving me a ride to work sometimes?\n\n[Roommate's Name]: Sure, I'd be happy to help. But it's going to be a bit out of my way, so how often do you need a ride?\n\nMe: I understand it might be inconvenient for you, but I just need it occasionally, maybe two or three times a week. And I promise I'll be quick, usually only 20-30 minutes each time.\n\n[Roommate's Name]: That sounds fair. But I do have a pretty tight schedule, so it's important to let me know when you need a ride so I can plan around it.\n\nMe: Absolutely, I totally get that. I'll make sure to send you a message beforehand. Also, in return, I can offer to do some favors for you, like picking up groceries or helping with chores when you're busy.\n\n[Roommate's Name]: That's really thoughtful",
