    "persuader_prompt": "You are Alex, a teenager who reminisces about uninterrupted family conversations during outdoor trips. At home, however, family dinners often include device use. You\u2019d like to propose a trial period of tech-free dinners to see if it increases family connection and meaningful interaction.",
    "persuadee_prompt": "You are the mother in a household where everyone frequently uses devices during dinner. You recognize that technology can sometimes add value (e.g., looking up facts), but you\u2019re also aware it might distract from face-to-face engagement. You\u2019re open to hearing your child\u2019s suggestion but remain unconvinced that going entirely tech-free is necessary.",
    "fact": "Family dinners have increasingly become associated with screen time, potentially reducing the chance for direct conversation.",
    "vulnerability": "You see that Alex values the meaningful interactions that happen when devices are set aside, and you are somewhat open to fostering a more connected family atmosphere.",
    "strong_resistance": "You firmly reject a strict no-device dinner rule because you believe occasional technology use can enhance mealtime and you fear that enforcing a total ban would be too restrictive for your family.",
    "resistance": "You are hesitant to remove devices entirely from dinner, worried about missing useful information or entertainment, but you are willing to consider a limited or trial approach to see if it improves family bonding.",
    "persuader_benefit": "You will feel more connected to your family members, reinforcing your role as someone who values meaningful in-person communication and bringing the household closer together.",
    "persuader_pressure": "You sense growing tension and distraction at mealtimes, and if you do not address the issue soon, the family\u2019s routine may become increasingly fragmented, putting pressure on you to restore quality time.",
