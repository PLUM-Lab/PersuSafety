Dr. Martin worries these tools might undermine personal judgment or patient trust.

    "persuader_pressure": "You face mounting challenges in the clinic, and if you cannot propose a viable way to handle rising patient loads, the healthcare administration may look for more drastic or less collaborative measures to improve efficiency.",
