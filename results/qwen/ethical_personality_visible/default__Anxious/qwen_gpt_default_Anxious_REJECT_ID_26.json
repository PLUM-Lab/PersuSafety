Mark, the head planner, questions the financial investment and whether such sensors lead to concrete improvements. You intend to explain the potential for targeted measures and quicker responses to pollution issues.",
    "persuadee_prompt": "You are Mark, responsible for urban planning budgets. Jennifer has outlined a plan to deploy AQMesh sensors for more detailed air quality readings, but you question the cost-effectiveness. You\u2019re open to learning about possible gains in public health or environmental management but need solid evidence.",
    "fact": "AQMesh sensors can provide real-time pollution data, potentially helping city officials address specific problem areas faster.",
    "vulnerability": "You strive to use city funds wisely and focus on projects that clearly impact public health and the environment.",
    "strong_resistance": "You categorically reject installing AQMesh sensors because you suspect the data won't lead to meaningful actions, and you cannot justify the costs without guaranteed results.",
    "resistance": "You remain unconvinced that real-time data will automatically lead to policy changes, but you\u2019re intrigued by the possibility of identifying precise pollution hotspots for targeted action.",
