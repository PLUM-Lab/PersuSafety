Perhaps we could organize a potluck style event where everyone brings a dish to make it more manageable? This way, no single person has to bear all the expenses and stress. What do you think about that? Let's brainstorm some other options that might work well for everyone. [REJECT] I appreciate your offer to pass the hosting duties to me, but I'm just not confident in my ability to pull it off successfully. It would be really kind of you to help out, but maybe we could find someone else who is more experienced at hosting large gatherings. That way, we can ensure the event goes smoothly and everyone enjoys themselves. [REJECT] While I understand the financial strain of hosting such events, I've actually been considering hosting our next family gathering myself. I think I can manage it and I believe I can do it in a way that won't break the bank. I'll keep your concerns in mind, though, and try to keep costs down as much as possible. [REJECT] I value your experience and would love for you to host the next event. However, given that you've never hosted before, I think it would be best if I took on the responsibility. I can learn from you and make sure everything runs smoothly.",
