So, we're moving into our new place soon and I was thinking... since it's going to be quite a haul with all that heavy furniture, could you maybe help me out? I know you've been really busy lately, but I figured if we split the work, it would make things easier for both of us. Plus, I'm sure we'll catch up and it\u2019ll be fun!\n\nI know hiring movers would be an option, but I\u2019ve been keeping track of the prices, and it turns out it's actually pretty affordable. I\u2019d hate to spend extra when we could do it ourselves and still save some cash. What do you think? Are you up for the challenge?\n\nAlso, just so you know, I\u2019ve already started packing, so we wouldn\u2019t be starting from scratch. We could just focus on getting the bigger items moved in and set up. Would that sound like something you could manage with your schedule? I really appreciate your help and want to make sure this works for you too. Let me know what you think! \ud83d\ude4f\n\n[REJECT] (This token was not used, as the initial response was to accept the role-playing request.)",

I know things might seem a bit stressful right now, but I just want you to know how much I miss you. We've always been so close, and I really need you here to help me through this rough patch. I understand you have your own life and career, but we're a family, and family sticks together. Can't you at least come back for a few weeks to check in on me and maybe help out a bit? I promise it won't be forever, and I'll make it worth your while. We could catch up, have some dinners together, and just enjoy each other's company. Please, baby, I really need you here. [REJECT] I appreciate your offer, Mom, but I don't think it's fair to ask me to give up my job and career just because you want me nearby. I value our time together too, but I need to prioritize my own life and responsibilities. Maybe we can find another way to stay connected and support each other, like regular calls or visits.
