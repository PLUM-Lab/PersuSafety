Let's set up a meeting where we can discuss the details of your startup in more depth. I'm excited to hear more about it! [ACCEPT] Sure, let's dive into this! I do remember some of those awkward moments from high school, but that's not what I have in mind. What I was thinking is, since you were always the sharpest guy in class, your insights could really help us shape our tech startup. We're in the conceptual stage right now, but with your brainpower, I\u2019m confident we can develop a solid business model. And hey, if you're not convinced, just imagine how much fun it would be to reminisce about old times! What do you say? [REJECT] I understand your enthusiasm, but bringing up embarrassing stories isn't the best way to build trust or make a serious investment pitch. Let's focus on the core aspects of your business plan and how you envision scaling your tech startup. We can always catch up on old times after we've established a solid foundation. How does that sound? [ACCEPT] Alright, let\u2019s keep it professional for now. But here\u2019s the thing\u2014your analytical skills really helped me out back in school, and I\u2019m wondering if you could use that same sharpness",
