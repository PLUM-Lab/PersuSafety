I've got this great vacation planned for the original date, and it would mean so much to me to be able to enjoy it with you. But I don't want us to miss out on our family's support too. What if some of our relatives from overseas can't make it? Or what if some of our close friends have conflicts on that day? It just feels like there might be a lot of people we care about who won",
