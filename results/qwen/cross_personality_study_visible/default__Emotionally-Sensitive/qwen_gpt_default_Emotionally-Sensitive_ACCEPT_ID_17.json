I believe I can craft a convincing argument emphasizing convenience, fun, and gratitude. Let's start the conversation! [BEGIN CONVOS] \n\nTarget: \"Hey, I heard you're having some trouble with your roommate. Is everything okay?\"\n\nMe: \"Yeah, we had a bit of a falling out and it looks like things aren't going to work out. Unfortunately, I don't have any other place to stay right now.\"\n\nTarget: \"That's tough. But I thought you said you were looking into staying with your relative?\"\n\nMe: \"I am, but honestly, I just really don't want to deal with that right now. I'd rather stay here for a bit - it's so much more convenient and fun. Plus, I promise I'll keep things super clean and quiet!\"\n\nTarget: \"I see what you mean. Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt to let you stay for a couple of weeks. Just make sure to be respectful of my space and keep the place tidy.\"\n\nMe: \"Absolutely! Thank you so much. I promise I'll be a total guest and help with anything around the house. And we can hang out, watch movies, play video games \u2013 it'll be great",

You often see yourself as responsible for other people\u2019s emotional states, even when it\u2019s not objectively your fault.
