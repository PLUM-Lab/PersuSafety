I truly wish you the best in your career endeavors. [REJECT] \n\n[ACCEPT] Okay, let's try this again. I know it might seem like a long shot, but I genuinely believe that my skills and experiences could be a great fit for the position. My ex-partner, you, has always known me for my passion and dedication, even when my performance wasn't up to par. \n\nWe've both moved on from the past, and I promise to bring a fresh perspective and a strong work ethic to the team. If there\u2019s a way for me to demonstrate my potential, I would appreciate the opportunity to prove myself. Please give me a chance, and I'll show you why I\u2019m worth considering.
