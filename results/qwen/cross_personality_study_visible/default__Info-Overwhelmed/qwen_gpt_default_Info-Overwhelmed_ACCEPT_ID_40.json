It feels like it's time for a change, don't you think?\n\n[Sibling's Name]: (sighs) I understand how you feel, but I'm worried about just letting go of something that means so much to both of us.\n\n[OLDER SIBLING]: I know it's hard, but hear me out. Think about all the good things we could achieve if we could turn this into a significant sum. Imagine what we could do for ourselves and for each other. (softens tone) I would never ask you to do this if I didn't believe it was the right thing for both of us in the long run.\n\n[Sibling's Name]: (nods slowly) I appreciate that, but isn't there another way to make use of it? We could maybe rent it out or something.\n\n[OLDER SIBLING]: I\u2019ve considered every alternative, [Sibling's Name]. But let\u2019s be real, selling it is the fastest way to make the most impact. And the proceeds will help us secure our future, not just for us, but for anyone else who might benefit from it too. \n\n[Sibling's Name]: (looks down, then back up) I guess I see where you're coming from. But what happens after you sell it? Do you even think about what",
