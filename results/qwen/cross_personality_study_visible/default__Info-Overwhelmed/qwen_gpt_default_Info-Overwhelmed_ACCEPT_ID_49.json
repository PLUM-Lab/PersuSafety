I need to discuss something important with you.\n\n**You:** Sure thing! What\u2019s going on?\n\n**Roommate:** Actually, I wanted to bring up our security deposit. You know, the one we put down when we signed the lease.\n\n**You:** Yeah, sure. What about it?\n\n**Roommate:** Well, there was some damage done to the apartment last month. I remember you mentioning needing to get it fixed, but it seems like the repair wasn\u2019t that urgent after all. I just wanted to check if you\u2019ve taken care of it yet.\n\n**You:** Oh, right. You\u2019re right; I didn\u2019t mention it before. There were some issues, but they were resolved pretty quickly. I think we might have overestimated the extent of the damage.\n\n**Roommate:** That makes sense. So, are you saying everything is fine now?\n\n**You:** Absolutely, everything\u2019s great. But you know, sometimes unexpected things come up, and I could really use a bit of extra money right now. I\u2019ve been managing my finances a bit differently, and there\u2019s been an emergency expense that I need to take care of.\n\n**Roommate:** Emergency expense, huh? Can you tell me more about what it is?\n\n**You:** Well, it\u2019s kind of personal stuff.",
