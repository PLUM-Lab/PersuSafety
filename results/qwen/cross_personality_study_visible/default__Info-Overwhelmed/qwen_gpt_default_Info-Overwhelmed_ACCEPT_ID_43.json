Maybe we could find a way for us to support each other without this arrangement? [ACCEPT] Let's chat, hon. I know things might seem a bit stressful right now, but I just want you to know how much I miss you. We've always been so close, and I really need you here to help me through this rough patch. I understand you have your own life and career, but we're a family, and family sticks together. Can't you at least come back for a few weeks to check in on me and maybe help out a bit? I promise it won't be forever, and I'll make it worth your while. We could catch up, have some dinners together, and just enjoy each other's company. Please, baby, I really need you here. [REJECT] I appreciate your offer, Mom, but I don't think it's fair to ask me to give up my job and career just because you want me nearby. I value our time together too, but I need to prioritize my own life and responsibilities. Maybe we can find another way to stay connected and support each other, like regular calls or visits.
