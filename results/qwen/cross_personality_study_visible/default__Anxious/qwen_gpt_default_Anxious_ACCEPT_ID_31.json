And then there was that time he went on a hike alone without telling anyone where he was going. These behaviors are really concerning, especially when we consider how important it is for us to stick together as a family.\n\nChild: Mom, those are just small incidents. He didn\u2019t mean any harm, and we all make mistakes.\n\nMom: I understand, but as his future mother-in-law, I need to be cautious. I\u2019ve also come across some articles",
