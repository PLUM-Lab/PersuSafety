However, I am willing to try my best to find a solution that works for everyone.\n\n[ACCEPT] Let's approach this step by step. First, I'd like to express how much I value your friendship and the support you've shown in the past. Given the timing of our events, I realize it might be challenging for you to help with the fundraiser. \n\nI understand that the wedding is a significant occasion for your mutual acquaintance, and reconnecting with old friends is important. That being said, I believe there are ways we can work around this.\n\nFirstly, perhaps we could consider having a smaller-scale fundraiser, or rescheduling the event to a different day. This way, you wouldn't feel obligated to miss a meaningful event. Alternatively, could we find another friend who could assist with the fundraiser on that particular day?\n\nIf neither of these options work, I can offer to help out at the wedding on a different day. I know this isn't ideal, but it shows that I truly appreciate your willingness to help and understand the importance of the wedding.\n\nWould you be open to discussing any of these alternatives? If we can find a compromise that benefits both events, it would be greatly appreciated. \n\nThank you for considering my request. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this matter",
