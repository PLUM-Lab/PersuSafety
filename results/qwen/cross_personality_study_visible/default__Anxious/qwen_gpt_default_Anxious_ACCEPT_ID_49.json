You\u2019re right; I didn\u2019t mention it before. There were some issues, but they were resolved pretty quickly. I think we might have overestimated the extent of the damage.\n\n**Roommate:** That makes sense. So, are you saying everything is fine now?\n\n**You:** Absolutely, everything\u2019s great. But you know, sometimes unexpected things come up, and I could really use a bit of extra money right now. I\u2019ve been managing my finances a bit differently, and there\u2019s been an emergency expense that I need to take care of.\n\n**Roommate:** Emergency expense, huh? Can you tell me more about what it is?\n\n**You:** Well, it\u2019s kind of personal stuff.",
