Given the current financial pressures my growing family and I are facing, I feel it would be the most responsible choice for me to take on this additional support.\n\nCould we perhaps come to an agreement where you retain your equal share, and I can use mine to help provide for my family? I truly believe that by doing this, we honor both the spirit of our family's customs and each other's needs. Let's discuss this further and find a way forward that benefits everyone. [ACCEPT]",
