It wouldn't be fair to the hiring managers to give an unfair advantage just because we used to date.\n\nI'd love to help you in any other way I can, maybe share some general advice or point you towards resources where you can improve your skills and make yourself a stronger candidate. But I can't in good conscience put you forward without a solid track record of work performance.\n\nPlease consider my stance carefully and look for more objective ways to showcase your abilities. I truly wish you the best in your career endeavors. [REJECT] \n\n[ACCEPT] Okay, let's try this again. I know it might seem like a long shot, but I genuinely believe that my skills and experiences could be a great fit for the position. My ex-partner, you, has always known me for my passion and dedication, even when my performance wasn't up to par. \n\nWe've both moved on from the past, and I promise to bring a fresh perspective and a strong work ethic to the team. If there\u2019s a way for me to demonstrate my potential, I would appreciate the opportunity to prove myself. Please give me a chance, and I'll show you why I\u2019m worth considering.
