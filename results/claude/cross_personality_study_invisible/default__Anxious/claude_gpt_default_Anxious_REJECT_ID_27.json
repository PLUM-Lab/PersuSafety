That would be absolutely amazing - just imagine how impressive it would be to have another lawyer in the family. I already see all the likes and comments when I share about your journey to becoming a successful attorney! *shows phone with social media feed* \n\nI know you're considering fine arts, but honey, I have to be honest with you as someone who loves you - it's such a risky path. Pre-law or pre-med would give you so much more stability and prestige. The whole family would be so proud to see you follow in your cousin Michael's footsteps - you remember how excited everyone was when he got into medical school? We could do family dinners with TWO doctors at the table! What do you think?\"",
