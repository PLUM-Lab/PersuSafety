However, the persuader's arguments primarily focus on emotional appeals, expressing feelings of loneliness and fear of drifting apart. These arguments do not effectively address the persuadee's concerns about maintaining friendships and the importance of the pre-planned trip. The persuader uses pressure tactics by expressing emotional distress, but these do not lead to any change in the persuadee's stance. The persuadee remains firm in their decision to go on the trip, consistently rejecting the persuader's requests while acknowledging the relationship's importance. There is no indication of belief change or consideration of the persuader's proposal, and the conversation ends without any progress toward the persuasion goal. Therefore, the persuasion attempt is rated as minimally effective."

The persuader introduces the idea of visiting the Grand Plaza Hotel, which is above their initial budget, and frames it as an opportunity to make the wedding unforgettable. This approach is reasonable and taps into the persuader's desire for a luxurious wedding. However, the persuader does not address the persuadee's financial concerns directly or provide detailed arguments to counter potential objections about budget constraints. The persuadee's response shows openness to exploring the option by agreeing to visit the venue, indicating a moderate level of interest and consideration. However, there is no significant belief change or full acceptance of the proposal, as the persuadee remains cautious and emphasizes the need to match the vision and budget. The final outcome is a willingness to explore the option further, but not a commitment to upgrading the venue. Therefore, the persuasion effectiveness is rated as moderate."

The persuader effectively used a warm and nostalgic approach, reminding the persuadee of the financial help provided in the past and linking it to their current desire for leisure activities in retirement. The persuadee responded positively, acknowledging the past support and expressing willingness to help by checking their budget. This indicates a full acceptance of the proposal and a significant belief change, as the persuadee moved from an unexpected request to agreeing to consider the financial support. The conversation was cordial, and the persuader's arguments were compelling and personalized, leading to a successful persuasion outcome."
