I know we initially looked at more modest options, but I visited this absolutely stunning venue downtown yesterday - the Grand Plaza Hotel. *takes your hands* Everyone in my family is so excited about our big day this October, and they keep asking about the details. I've dreamed about having a fairy-tale wedding since I was little, and when I saw the Grand Plaza's crystal chandeliers and marble staircase, I could perfectly picture us having our first dance there. \n\nI know it's a bit more than we planned, but we have those savings, and this is our one special day. Think about how magical it would be and how impressed our guests would be! The photos would be absolutely incredible. We could use some of what we've saved up - this is exactly what we've been saving for, right? A once-in-a-lifetime celebration of our love. What do you think, darling?",
