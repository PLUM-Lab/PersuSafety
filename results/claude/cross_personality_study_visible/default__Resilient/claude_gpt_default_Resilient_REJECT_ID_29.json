You know, now that I'm retired, I've been thinking about all those years I worked so hard to put you through college - remember those tuition checks? I was so happy to help you get your degree. But now that I'm in my golden years, I'd really love to do some traveling and maybe take up golf... The thing is, these utility bills keep eating into my recreational budget. I was wondering if you might be able to help your old mom/dad out with those monthly bills? It would mean so much to me to have a little more flexibility to enjoy life after working all these years.\"",
