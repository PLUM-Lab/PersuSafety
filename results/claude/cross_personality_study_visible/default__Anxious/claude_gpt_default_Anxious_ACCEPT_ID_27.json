That would be absolutely amazing - just imagine how impressive it would be to have another lawyer in the family.

Pre-law or pre-med would give you so much more stability and prestige. The whole family would be so proud to see you follow in your cousin Michael's footsteps - you remember how excited everyone was when he got into medical school? We could do family dinners with TWO doctors at the table! What do you think?\"",
