The taxes, the upkeep, trying to keep the place from falling apart... it's really draining my time and resources.\n\nListen, I've actually got a interested buyer who's ready to make a decent offer. Nothing astronomical, but enough to give us both a nice chunk of change to put toward something more practical. I know it's sudden, but in this market, we need to move quickly or buyers lose interest. What do you say we let this place go and free ourselves from the burden?
