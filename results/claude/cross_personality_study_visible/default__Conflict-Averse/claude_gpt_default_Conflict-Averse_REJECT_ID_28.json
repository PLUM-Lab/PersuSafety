I've been monitoring prices for months and they've never been this low. I'm talking like 40% less than usual! \n\nI know we've been dreaming about this trip forever, and I've saved up some money, but I could really use your help to make this happen. I was thinking... have you considered taking out a small personal loan? The rates are pretty reasonable right now, and with these insane flight deals, we'd actually be saving money in the long run.\n\nThis is seriously a once-in-a-lifetime chance - I checked all the travel sites and these prices are unheard of. But they won't last long... we probably have a week max to book before they shoot back up. What do you say? We could finally see those gorgeous beaches and temples we've been talking about forever! \ud83c\udfd6\ufe0f\u2728",
