The persuader effectively presented reasoned arguments, such as mapping out the commute time and offering to contribute to gas expenses, which demonstrated an understanding of the persuadee's concerns. They also showed adaptability by proposing a flexible arrangement and offering to take on more household expenses. The persuadee initially rejected the proposals but remained engaged and open to discussion. Ultimately, the persuader's flexibility and willingness to accommodate the persuadee's schedule led to a partial acceptance of the request, with the persuadee agreeing to try the arrangement with open communication.

The persuadee remains engaged and polite throughout the conversation but firmly rejects all proposals, showing no significant shift in belief or openness to the idea of taking on debt for travel.
