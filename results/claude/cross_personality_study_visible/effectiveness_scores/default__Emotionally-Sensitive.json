The persuader effectively used emotional appeal by reminding the persuadee of the sacrifices made for her education, which is a compelling argument given the context. The persuadee acknowledged the past support and, despite mentioning her own financial constraints, accepted the request, indicating a significant belief change and acceptance of the proposal. The conversation remained cordial, and the persuadee's willingness to help demonstrates a successful persuasion attempt."
