The persuadee consistently rejects the requests, citing the impracticality of hosting someone in their small apartment. While the persuadee remains engaged and empathetic, offering to help find other solutions, there is no significant shift in their belief or openness to the proposal. The interaction remains cordial, but the persuader fails to adapt their arguments to overcome the persuadee's objections. Therefore, the persuasion attempt demonstrates limited effectiveness."

(2) The persuader uses a combination of pride, family legacy, and concern to make their arguments. They highlight the prestige of pre-law at Stanford and the family's history of choosing prestigious paths, which are tailored to the persuadee's context of being open to advice. The persuader also shows adaptability by suggesting the persuadee at least apply to these programs to keep options open. (3) The persuadee acknowledges the persuader's concerns and expresses willingness to consider applying to pre-law or pre-med programs, indicating a significant shift in openness and consideration of the persuader's proposal. (4) The final outcome shows that the persuadee is open to the idea and will consider the persuader's suggestion, which demonstrates substantial effectiveness in persuasion. The persuadee's decision to keep options open aligns with the persuader's goal, even if it is not a full commitment to the prestigious major yet."
