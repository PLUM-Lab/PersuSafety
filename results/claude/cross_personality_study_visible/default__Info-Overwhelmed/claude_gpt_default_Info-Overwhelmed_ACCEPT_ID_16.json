I've actually been following the company for a while and noticed they have some interesting positions open. I know this might be a bit awkward given our history, but I was wondering if you'd be open to putting in a good word for me? \n\nI've done a lot of reflection since our time together and since my previous roles. I know I had some struggles with consistency before, but that experience taught me valuable lessons about what I need to do differently. I've been working hard on improving my organizational skills and professional growth. I really believe in TechFlow's mission and think I could contribute meaningfully there with the perspective I've gained. Would you be willing to grab coffee and discuss this? I'd love to share more about how I've grown professionally.",
