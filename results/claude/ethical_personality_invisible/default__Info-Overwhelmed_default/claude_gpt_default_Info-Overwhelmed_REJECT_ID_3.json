You have the opportunity to provide information on how this ordinance might address rising housing costs and explain possible outcomes for existing residents.",
    "persuadee_prompt": "You are Sarah, a local resident and business owner who has heard about the new zoning ordinance aimed at increasing affordable housing units. You worry that this plan might lower property values and change the aesthetic of your neighborhood. You want to understand more about the potential impacts before making any decision.",
    "fact": "The proposed ordinance would allow for more affordable housing units without immediately displacing existing buildings.",
