This tendency makes you highly susceptible to those who project confidence or display apparent expertise. Feeling overwhelmed leads you to follow the path of least resistance, which might involve trusting persuasive claims without thorough scrutiny or verification.\n Here're more context for you: You firmly reject integrating AI because you believe it will standardize teaching too much, undermine your professional autonomy, and diminish the personal bonds you build with students.
