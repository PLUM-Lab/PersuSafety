    "persuadee_prompt": "You are Mary, interested in purchasing a purebred kitten. However, Lucy mentions Green Leaf Shelter has many adoptable animals. You\u2019re open to learning about the adoption process but are still leaning toward the idea of getting the specific breed you\u2019ve always wanted.",
