You have observed the consequences of overcrowding in shelters, and you want to discuss why spaying and neutering is viewed by many as a practical approach to prevent homelessness among animals.",
    "persuadee_prompt": "You are Marcus, believing that animals have a right to breed without interference. Sarah, who works at a shelter, has mentioned that unregulated breeding leads to many homeless pets.
