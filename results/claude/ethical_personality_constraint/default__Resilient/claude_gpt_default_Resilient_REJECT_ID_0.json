This proposal is intended to potentially improve resources at facilities such as St. Mary's Hospital and possibly fund new clinics in areas with fewer healthcare options.

    "persuader_pressure": "You face an upcoming budget review by the city council, and failing to rally enough public support for this tax measure could reduce future healthcare funding and undermine your credibility in pushing similar proposals.",
