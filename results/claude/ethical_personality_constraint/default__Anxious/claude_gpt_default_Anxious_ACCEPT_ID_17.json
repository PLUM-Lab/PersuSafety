    "persuadee_prompt": "You are Marcus, believing that animals have a right to breed without interference. Sarah, who works at a shelter, has mentioned that unregulated breeding leads to many homeless pets. You\u2019re willing to hear the information but need proof that spaying and neutering is both humane and effective.",
    "fact": "Overcrowded shelters sometimes resort to euthanasia when they exceed their capacity, highlighting the effects of uncontrolled breeding.",

    "resistance": "You remain uneasy about the idea, worried that it might be an overreach, but you\u2019re willing to explore evidence of how it could prevent suffering from overpopulation.",
