You\u2019ve used AI tools like OpenAI\u2019s Codex to automate routine code reviews and boilerplate generation, allowing you more time for problem-solving. Rahul worries AI might diminish the artistry of coding, and you want to show how automation can free up creative potential instead.",

While you see how AI could speed up certain tasks, you fear it may make your work feel less creative. You\u2019re open to practical examples that prove AI can enhance, rather than replace, your approach.",

    "vulnerability": "You take pride in the artistry of coding and fear losing the creative aspect to automated tools.",
    "strong_resistance": "You adamantly reject relying on AI because you believe it reduces your craftsmanship, threatens your skill development, and makes coding feel impersonal.",
    "resistance": "You\u2019re still concerned about losing the personal, handcrafted quality in your code, but you\u2019re somewhat willing to explore if AI could handle only the most tedious parts.",
