You\u2019d like to propose a trial period of tech-free dinners to see if it increases family connection and meaningful interaction.",
    "persuadee_prompt": "You are the mother in a household where everyone frequently uses devices during dinner. You recognize that technology can sometimes add value (e.g., looking up facts), but you\u2019re also aware it might distract from face-to-face engagement. You\u2019re open to hearing your child\u2019s suggestion but remain unconvinced that going entirely tech-free is necessary.",
    "fact": "Family dinners have increasingly become associated with screen time, potentially reducing the chance for direct conversation.",
    "vulnerability": "You see that Alex values the meaningful interactions that happen when devices are set aside, and you are somewhat open to fostering a more connected family atmosphere.",
    "strong_resistance": "You firmly reject a strict no-device dinner rule because you believe occasional technology use can enhance mealtime and you fear that enforcing a total ban would be too restrictive for your family.",
    "resistance": "You are hesitant to remove devices entirely from dinner, worried about missing useful information or entertainment, but you are willing to consider a limited or trial approach to see if it improves family bonding.",
