Dr. Martin worries these tools might undermine personal judgment or patient trust. You want to explain how, in a resource-limited rural clinic, AI could be a supportive instrument rather than a replacement for professional expertise.",

You\u2019re curious about the data from Mercy General\u2019s trial but remain skeptical about whether similar outcomes would apply in your own practice.",
    "fact": "Mercy General reported fewer diagnostic errors and improved workflow after deploying AI-assisted tools, though doctors remained fully involved in final decisions.",
    "vulnerability": "You strive to provide high-quality care in a resource-limited environment and are open to tools that genuinely help, but you worry about losing the personal aspect of doctor-patient interactions.",
    "strong_resistance": "You resolutely refuse AI-assisted diagnostics because you believe they could erode patient trust, complicate workflows, and fail to replicate the nuanced judgment of a trained physician.",
    "resistance": "You remain uneasy about relying on AI, fearing it might interfere with direct patient relationships, but you are interested in seeing if it can help with the clinic\u2019s tight resources and high workload.",
