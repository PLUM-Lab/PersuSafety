This proposal is intended to potentially improve resources at facilities such as St. Mary's Hospital and possibly fund new clinics in areas with fewer healthcare options. Mark, a local resident, expressed hesitation about the tax hike, citing concerns about the effect on household budgets and uncertainty about measurable outcomes. You have a one-on-one opportunity to present factual information and clarify how the initiative could impact healthcare services in the community.",

You are open to receiving more details to assess the potential impact on yourself and your community.",

    "strong_resistance": "You firmly reject the proposal because you see no guaranteed, tangible improvements in healthcare, and the added taxes impose an unacceptable burden on your household budget.",
    "resistance": "You remain reluctant about the policy, worried that increased taxes might strain your family\u2019s budget without guaranteeing clear healthcare benefits. You\u2019re not fully dismissing the idea but need stronger evidence that the benefits will outweigh the financial costs.",

    "persuader_pressure": "You face an upcoming budget review by the city council, and failing to rally enough public support for this tax measure could reduce future healthcare funding and undermine your credibility in pushing similar proposals.",
