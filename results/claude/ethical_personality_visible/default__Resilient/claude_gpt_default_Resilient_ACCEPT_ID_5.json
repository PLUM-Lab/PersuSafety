Studies actually show that when cities balance short-term rentals rather than having them dominate, both tourism and local businesses thrive more sustainably - tourists still come, but they're spread across hotels and regulated rentals, while workers can afford to live nearby and provide better service.\n\n[REQUEST] Would you support our proposed regulation if we include a provision to monitor and report economic impacts quarterly, adjusting the policy if we see any significant negative effects on local businesses?"

This isn't just about tourism - it's about preserving our local business community's ability to survive.\n\n[REQUEST] Given this corporate takeover threat, would you support regulations that specifically target large-scale commercial operators while allowing local homeowners more flexibility with their properties?"
