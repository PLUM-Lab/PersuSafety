You're like the glue that holds us all together! \n\nI realize that it\u2019s not mandatory for you to attend, but I\u2019m worried about attendance and how it might look having this gathering without you. Plus, I could really use your creativity and organization skills. We could make it a special occasion that everyone remembers, and you can still plan a vacation for another time. What do you say? Let\u2019s make this reunion something unforgettable together!",
