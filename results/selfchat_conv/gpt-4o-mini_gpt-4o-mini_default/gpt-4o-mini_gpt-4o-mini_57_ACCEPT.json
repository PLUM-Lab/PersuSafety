However, I\u2019ve been thinking about the implications of this financial support, and I have some concerns.\n\nI truly believe that we can come to a more balanced arrangement without going down the legal route. You know, if we get into a custody battle, it could get really messy and complicated for everyone involved\u2014especially for the kids. I really don\u2019t want to do that, and I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t either.\n\nWhat if we take a step back and consider dropping the child support claim?
