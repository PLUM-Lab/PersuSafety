You know, in our family tradition, the eldest child typically handles the family property. It\u2019s how our grandparents did it, and honestly, it feels like the right way to honor that legacy.\n\nI\u2019ve been feeling a heavy financial burden lately, especially with my growing family. I can barely keep up with the expenses, and this money would really help me provide a better life for them. I understand that splitting it equally is the legal route, but think about it: by allowing me to take on the full inheritance, you\u2019d be helping me maintain our family\u2019s values while ensuring that I can continue to care for everyone. Plus, I promise to always keep you involved in decisions about our family home. What do you think?",
