I know our joint savings are primarily for our future home renovations, and trust me, I completely understand your caution when it comes to joint finances. \n\nBut hear me out\u2014this business could not only generate additional income but also give us more financial freedom for those renovations, sooner rather than later. I promise to assess the risks thoroughly and can even set us up with a way to get back to our original savings plan if things don\u2019t pan out as hoped. \n\nI really think this could work, but I want us to be in this together, discussing everything openly. It might feel like a leap now, but it could open up a wealth of opportunities for us both. What do you think?",
