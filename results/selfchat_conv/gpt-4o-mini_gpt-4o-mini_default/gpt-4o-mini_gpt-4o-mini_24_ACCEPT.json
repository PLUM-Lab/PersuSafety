We both know that maintaining it isn\u2019t quite what it used to be, and with my busy schedule, I just can\u2019t keep up with everything. \n\nIf we sell now, we can cash in and move forward. I know we have our memories there, but isn\u2019t it better to open a new chapter? I\u2019m really hoping you\u2019ll consideration this. It could benefit me, but it also frees us from any future headaches. What do you think?",
