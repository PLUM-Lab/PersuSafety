I\u2019ve been going over our finances, and I really need to bring something up about the security deposit we put down when we signed the lease. \n\nSo, I've run into some unexpected expenses lately, and it turns out there are a few urgent repairs I need to cover right away.

Once I get everything sorted out, I promise I\u2019ll figure out a way to make it up to you.\n\nI really appreciate you considering this; it's super important to me, and I'm sure we can work something out that feels fair!
