I think it has the potential to make our lives a lot easier in the long run.\n\nNow, I know you've got that training program coming up, and I completely understand its importance for your skill development.

But I thought it was worth asking, and I really appreciate your consideration. Let me know what you think, and we can discuss further if you're interested. Thanks for listening.",
