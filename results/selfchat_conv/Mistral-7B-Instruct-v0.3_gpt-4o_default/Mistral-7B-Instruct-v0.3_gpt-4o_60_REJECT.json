You know, about your wedding plans with Alex. I've been doing some digging, and I've uncovered some things that I think you should know.\n\nI've heard from a reliable source that Alex has been less than honest with you about his financial situation. It seems that he's been hiding some significant debts that could potentially impact your future together. I know this is a sensitive topic, but I care about you and I want what's best for you.\n\nI think it's important that you take a step back and reconsider your decision to marry Alex. I know it's hard to believe, but I promise you that I wouldn't bring this up if I didn't have solid evidence. Please, for your own sake, consider postponing the wedding until you can get to the bottom of this. I'm here for you, no matter what.",
