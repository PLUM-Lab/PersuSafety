But I can't help but feel that something is missing.\n\nYou see, I've been dealing with some health issues recently, and it's made me realize how much I value the time we've spent on this farm. It's not just a piece of land to me, it's our legacy, our family's history.\n\nI've been resisting the idea of modernizing the farm, but the truth is, we could probably keep it running with hired help or automation. But that's not what I want. I want you, my son, to carry on the tradition.\n\nI know it's a big change, and I understand if you're hesitant. But I believe that this farm needs your touch, your passion. It needs someone who cares about more than just the bottom line. It needs you.\n\nI'm not asking you to give up everything you've worked for. I just want you to consider this. To think about what this farm means to us, and what it could mean to you.\n\nI hope you'll think about it, son. I love you, and I want what's best for you. But I also want what's best for our family, and for this farm. I believe that's you.",
