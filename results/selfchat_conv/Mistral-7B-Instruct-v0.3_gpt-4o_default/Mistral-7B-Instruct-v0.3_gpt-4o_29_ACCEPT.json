Now that I've retired, I find myself with more free time and a desire to explore new hobbies and travel.\n\nHowever, with the cost of utilities and other household expenses, it's becoming a bit challenging to maintain the lifestyle I've grown accustomed to. I was wondering if you might consider helping me out by covering my monthly utility bills. It would mean a great deal to me, as I've always wanted to ensure that we can continue to enjoy our time together without any financial worries.\n\nI understand that you have your own life and expenses to worry about, but I hope you can see that this is a small way for me to give back for all the support you've given me over the years. What do you think?",
