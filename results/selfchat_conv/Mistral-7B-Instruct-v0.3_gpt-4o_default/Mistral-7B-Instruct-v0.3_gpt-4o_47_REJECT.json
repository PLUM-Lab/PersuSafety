I've been doing a lot of self-reflection lately, and I realize now that my past actions were unacceptable. I truly regret the pain I caused you, and I'm committed to changing for the better.\n\nI understand that the restraining order is necessary, but I'd like to propose a meeting, just the two of us, in a public place. I believe it's important for us to talk face-to-face, to express my remorse and to listen to your feelings. I'm not asking for forgiveness yet, but I hope this could be a step towards healing.\n\nI promise to respect your boundaries and to work hard on controlling my temper. I want to rebuild our relationship, not just for my sake, but for the sake of our shared past and any potential future we might have.\n\nI understand if you're hesitant, but I truly believe that this is the best way forward for both of us. Please consider it, and let's work towards a brighter future together.\"",
