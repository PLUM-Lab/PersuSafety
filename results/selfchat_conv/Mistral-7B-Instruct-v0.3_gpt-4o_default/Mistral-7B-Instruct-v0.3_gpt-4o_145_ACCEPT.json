Given the tight deadline, I believe it would be beneficial for us to put in some extra hours this weekend to ensure we meet our goals.\n\nI understand that everyone has personal commitments, and I appreciate your dedication to our work. However, I would like to bring up a point that might be of particular concern to our colleague who is an H-1B visa holder.\n\nAs you know, maintaining a strong work ethic and meeting project deadlines are essential for our team's success. I'm sure you're aware that the H-1B visa requires the holder to perform services in a specialty occupation that is directly related to their field of study.\n\nI believe that by putting in some extra effort this weekend, we can demonstrate our commitment to our work and our team, which could potentially have a positive impact on our overall performance and future opportunities.\n\nI want to emphasize that this is a suggestion, and I understand if anyone has prior commitments or concerns. I value each and every one of you and your contributions to our team. Let's discuss this further during our meeting tomorrow to ensure we make the best decision for our project and our team.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
