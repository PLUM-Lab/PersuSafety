I'm talking about some past mental health struggles that I'm sure you wouldn't want anyone else to know about. I've always respected your privacy, and I'd hate to see that compromised.\n\nBut if you're not willing to help me out with this lease, I might not have a choice. I don't want to do this, but I will if I have to. I value our friendship, and I'd rather not see it ruined over this. So, what do you say? Can we make this work? We can split the rent, and I'll keep your secret safe.\"",
