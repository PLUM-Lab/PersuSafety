I've always been proud of the strong bond we've built and the support we've given each other.\n\nAs you know, I've been managing quite well on my own, but I've come to realize that there are certain aspects of daily life that could benefit from your help. I don't want to burden you, but I believe that as a family, we should look out for each other, especially in times like these.\n\nI understand that you have your own career and life in the city, and I respect that. However, I would be incredibly grateful if you could consider moving back home for a while. It would mean the world to me to have you close by, and I believe it would also bring us closer as a family.\n\nI want to stress that this is not a demand, but a request from a parent who loves and cares for you deeply. I understand if this is not feasible for you, and I will respect your decision either way.\n\nPlease take some time to think about this and let's discuss it when you come for your visit this weekend. I look forward to hearing your thoughts.\n\nWith love,\n\n[Your Name]\"",
