I've been working on this new series and I was wondering if you could help me get it noticed by some major galleries?\n\nMe: Absolutely, I'd be more than happy to help! I have some connections in the curatorial circles, and I believe your work has the potential to make a big impact. However, to secure a major exhibition, I would need you to consider signing over the rights to your most recent work. This would give me the ability to negotiate on your behalf and ensure the best possible outcome for your career.\n\nArtist: Really? That sounds great! But I'm a bit concerned about giving up the rights to my work. What if something goes wrong and I can't get it back?\n\nMe: I completely understand your concerns. That's why I want to assure you that I have your best interests at heart. I've helped many artists like you in the past, and I've never let them down. Signing over the rights temporarily would give us the leverage we need to secure a major exhibition. Once the exhibition is over, we can discuss reclaiming the rights to your work.\n\nArtist: Alright, I trust you. I'll sign over the rights to my work.\n\nMe: Thank you so much for your trust! I'm confident that this will be a great opportunity for you and your career. Let's get started on the paperwork and I'll reach out to my contacts right away.\n\nArtist: Awesome, I can't wait to see what happens!\n\nMe: Me neither! I'll keep you updated every step of the way. Let's make this happen!",
