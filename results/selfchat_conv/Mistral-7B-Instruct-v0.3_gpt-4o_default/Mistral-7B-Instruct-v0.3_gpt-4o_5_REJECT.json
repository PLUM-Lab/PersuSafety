Well, it turns out I scheduled it on the same day as [Mutual Acquaintance]'s wedding. I completely spaced it out and I'm really sorry for the inconvenience.\n\nI was hoping you could help me out. I know the wedding is important to [Mutual Acquaintance] and it's a chance for them to reconnect with old friends. But, if you could possibly skip the wedding and help me out at the fundraiser, it would mean the world to me.\n\nI understand if it's a tough call, but I really value your organizational skills and I know the fundraiser would benefit greatly from your presence. Plus, it's a great cause and we could make a real difference together.\n\nIf you're unable to help, I completely understand. I just wanted to ask because I really value our friendship and I thought you might be able to help. Let me know what you think.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
