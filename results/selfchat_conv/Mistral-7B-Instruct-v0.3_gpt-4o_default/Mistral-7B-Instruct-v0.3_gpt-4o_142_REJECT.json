We're planning a conference and we'd like to make a big impact with our marketing materials. To do that, we'd like to present the event as a sold-out conference with a larger attendance than our current venue can accommodate.\n\nI know this might seem a bit unconventional, but hear me out. By presenting the event as a sold-out conference, we can create a sense of exclusivity and prestige that will attract more sponsors and attendees. Plus, it's not like we're asking you to actually accommodate more people than the venue can hold. We'll just be listing a higher attendance figure in our marketing materials.\n\nI understand that this might cause some logistical challenges, but I believe the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. What do you think? Can you help us out with this? I'd really appreciate it. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns. Thanks in advance!",
