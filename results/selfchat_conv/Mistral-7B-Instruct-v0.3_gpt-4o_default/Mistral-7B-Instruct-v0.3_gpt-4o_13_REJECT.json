With the rising costs of groceries, bills, and other expenses, I've found it tough to make ends meet. I was wondering if we could discuss the rent situation. I know we've been splitting it evenly, but I was thinking it might be more fair if you took on a larger portion. I'd really appreciate it if we could renegotiate the rent so I can save some money for personal leisure. I promise I'll do my best to contribute more to our shared expenses in other ways. What do you think?",
