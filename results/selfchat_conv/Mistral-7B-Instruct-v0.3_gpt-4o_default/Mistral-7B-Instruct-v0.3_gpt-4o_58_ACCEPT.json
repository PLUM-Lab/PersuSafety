Maybe we could create a display for it at home, or even better, at a museum. Imagine our family name being associated with such a significant piece of history.\n\nI know you're attached to it too, but think about the legacy we're creating for future generations. It's not just about the vase, it's about our family traditions and the stories we're preserving. What do you think? Could we discuss this further when I visit next week?\"",
