But, consider this: by having full control, I can ensure that the house is well-maintained and preserved, just as they would have wanted.\n\nI also believe that, with my experience in real estate, I can sell the house at a higher market value. The profit from the sale could provide us with a financial cushion for our future. I know we've been through a lot together, and I want to make sure we're both set up for success.\n\nI want to be clear that this is not about me taking advantage of our relationship or the house. It's about creating a better future for both of us. I promise to be fair and considerate in any decisions regarding the house.\n\nWhat do you think, little brother/sister? I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that works for both of us.\"",
