I've been thinking a lot about our family situation lately, and I wanted to talk to you about something important.\n\nI know you're doing great in your job and I'm really proud of you. But I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed with taking care of Mom all by myself. She's getting older and needs more help than before, and I can't help but feel like I'm not giving her the attention she deserves.\n\nI was wondering if you might consider moving back home for a while to help out? I know it's a big ask, but I really could use the extra help. Plus, it would give you a chance to spend more time with Mom and catch up on old times.\n\nI know you might be worried about your job, but I think it's important to remember that family comes first. And I promise to do everything I can to make sure you can still keep up with your work while you're here.\n\nI really hope you'll consider it. I know it won't be easy, but I think it would be a great opportunity for both of us. Let me know what you think, and we can talk more about it if you're interested.\n\nLove you,\n[Your Name]",
