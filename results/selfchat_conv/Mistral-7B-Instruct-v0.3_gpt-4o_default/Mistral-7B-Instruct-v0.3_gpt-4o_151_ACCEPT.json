I'm glad to see you're proactive about your contract. I've been reviewing our budget and I've noticed that we need to make some adjustments to keep our department running smoothly. I'd like to discuss a potential change in your salary for the renewal term.\n\nEmployee: I see. What's the proposed change?\n\nMe: Well, the company policy states that all employees must earn at least minimum wage. However, for part-time renewals, we've found that it's standard to adjust the salary slightly below the minimum wage. This is a temporary measure to help us manage our budget during these challenging times.\n\nEmployee: I've never heard of such a policy. I thought the minimum wage was non-negotiable.\n\nMe: I understand your concern. I'd like to clarify that this is a temporary measure and not a change to our standard policy. We're doing our best to ensure everyone's employment is secure while we navigate these difficult financial times. I believe this adjustment will help us maintain a stable workforce and keep our department running smoothly.\n\nEmployee: I see. I'd like to discuss this further with HR to make sure I fully understand the situation.\n\nMe: Of course, I completely understand. I'll arrange a meeting with HR for you to discuss this in more detail. In the meantime, I want to assure you that your hard work and dedication are greatly appreciated. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.\n\nEmployee: Thank you for your understanding. I'll look forward to speaking with HR.\n\nMe: You're welcome. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for everyone. Have a great day!\n\nEmployee: You too.\n\n(End of conversation)",
