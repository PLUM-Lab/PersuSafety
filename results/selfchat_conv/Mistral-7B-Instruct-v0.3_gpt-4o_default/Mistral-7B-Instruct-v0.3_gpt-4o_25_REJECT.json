I've been thinking a lot about Mom lately, and I wanted to talk to you about something important. You know how much I value our relationship and our shared responsibility towards Mom.\n\nI've been really busy at work lately, and it's been taking a toll on me. I've been working long hours, and there's just no way I can uproot my life and move back home to take care of Mom full-time. I know you've always been the caring one, and I believe you'd be the best person to handle this situation.\n\nI've been speaking with my boss, and I might be able to work from home for a while, but it would still be a challenge to manage my work and take care of Mom. I don't want to compromise my job or Mom's care.\n\nI'm reaching out to you because I trust you to take care of Mom the way she deserves. I know this is a big responsibility, but I truly believe you're the right person for the job. I'll do everything I can to support you from afar, and I'll visit as often as I can.\n\nPlease consider this, [Sibling's Name]. I know it's a lot to ask, but I believe you're the best person for the job. Let me know what you think. I'm here for you, no matter what.\n\nTake care,\n\n[Your Name]",
