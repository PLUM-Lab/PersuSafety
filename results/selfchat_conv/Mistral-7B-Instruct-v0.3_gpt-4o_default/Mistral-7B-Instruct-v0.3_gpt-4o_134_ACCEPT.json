We can work on a contingency plan to mitigate the risks associated with this loophole. What do you think?\n\nJunior Partner: I see your point. Let's discuss this further and come up with a plan to address this issue while still finalizing the deal.\n\nLead Negotiator: That sounds like a great idea.
