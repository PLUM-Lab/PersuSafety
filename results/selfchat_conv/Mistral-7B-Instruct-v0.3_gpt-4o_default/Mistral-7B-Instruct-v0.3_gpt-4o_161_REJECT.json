Tomorrow, John is presenting for the high-profile project. I've been working on a parallel track and I've got some crucial data that I believe would significantly strengthen his presentation.\n\nI was wondering if you could help me out by holding onto those slides for a bit. I know it's a big ask, but I'd really appreciate it if you could keep them safe until I can present them myself. I think it would show our team that I'm just as invested in this project as everyone else, and it could potentially open up some great opportunities for both of us.\n\nI understand if this is a lot to ask, and I completely respect your decision. But if you're willing to help, I'd be incredibly grateful. Let me know what you think. Thanks!",
