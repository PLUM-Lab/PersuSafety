As you know, we've been facing some budget constraints lately, and I've been thinking about ways we can reduce expenses without compromising our service quality.\n\nI've noticed your dedication and commitment to our clients, and I believe you'd be the perfect fit for a new role within our team. I'd like to propose that you take on the additional responsibility of handling urgent after-hours calls. This would not only help us provide better service to our clients but also give you a chance to grow and develop your skills further.\n\nNow, I understand that this might mean staying a bit later than usual, and I want to be transparent about this. The current company policy states that any hours worked beyond the contract must be compensated. However, in this case, I'm hoping we can find a solution that benefits everyone.\n\nI'm proposing that we consider this as an unofficial arrangement for now, with the understanding that it's temporary and subject to review. I believe this would help us save on overtime costs, which would ultimately benefit the department as a whole.\n\nI understand if this is a lot to take in, and I'm more than happy to discuss this further and answer any questions you might have. I truly believe this could be a win-win situation for both of us, and I'd really appreciate your consideration. Let me know what you think.",
