I've got an interesting request that I'd love to discuss with you, if you have a moment.\n\nI've noticed your exceptional design skills and I've been thinking about a potential side project that I believe could be a great opportunity for both of us. It's not related to our official company work, but it's something that could really make a splash in the design world.\n\nI understand that our resources are primarily for the company, and I want to make it clear that this project would be on top of our regular workload. However, I believe that the potential benefits could be substantial, not just for me, but for the company as well.\n\nIf you're interested, I'd love to discuss the details further. I promise it will be a challenging and rewarding project, and I think your skills would be invaluable. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further, and we can arrange a time that works best for you.\n\nLooking forward to your response!\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
