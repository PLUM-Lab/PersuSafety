I know we had previously agreed on a certain division, but I wanted to discuss it with you, as I find myself in a slightly different financial situation than I was when we made that agreement.\n\nI've been considering a few opportunities that have come up recently, and while they are exciting, they do require a bit more financial investment than I currently have. I believe that with a slightly larger share of the inheritance, I could seize these opportunities and potentially create a more secure future for myself.\n\nI understand that this is a significant decision and I don't want to put you in a difficult position. I just wanted to bring it to your attention and discuss it with you. I value your opinion and your support, and I trust that we can find a solution that works for both of us.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this. I look forward to discussing it further with you when it's convenient for you.\n\nWith love,\n[Your Name]",
