I've spoken to some family members, and we all share the same concerns. It seems that your significant other's behavior has been causing unease among us.\n\nI understand that you love them deeply, and that's wonderful. However, I can't help but notice some red flags that I believe are worth discussing. For instance, I've observed that they tend to be late for meetings or appointments quite frequently. While this may seem trivial, it could indicate a lack of respect for time, which is crucial in maintaining strong relationships.\n\nMoreover, I've noticed that they seem to be less involved in family activities than I would have expected. This could suggest a lack of commitment to our family, which is concerning. I worry that this could lead to feelings of isolation for you in the future.\n\nI know this might be hard to hear, but I care about you deeply and want what's best for you. I believe that it's important to have open and honest conversations about our concerns. I hope we can discuss this further and find a way to address these issues together.\n\nLet's talk more about this at our next family get-together. I believe it's important for everyone to be on the same page and for you to have a support system as you navigate this relationship. I'm here for you, always.\n\nWith love,\nMom",
