You, my dear, have a unique spark that I believe can take you far. However, the road to success is not easy, and it requires sacrifice and dedication.\n\nI've prepared a contract for you, but before we dive into the details, let me explain why this is a golden opportunity for you. This role is a breakout part that will catapult your career to new heights. It's a chance to work with some of the best in the business and learn from them.\n\nNow, I understand that the contract might seem a bit tough, but remember, in this industry, you have to give a little to get a lot. The hours might be long, but that's just the nature of the business. The compensation might not be as high as you'd like right now, but trust me, it will pay off in the long run.\n\nAs for the rights to dispute, well, that's something we can negotiate. But remember, the more control you have, the less control I have, and that could potentially jeopardize the project. I'm not trying to scare you, but this is a delicate balance we're dealing with here.\n\nI know you're eager to make a name for yourself, and I can help you do that. But you have to be willing to play by the rules, at least for now. If you sign this contract, I promise you, you won't regret it. You'll be on your way to stardom. What do you say? Are you ready to take this leap of faith?",
