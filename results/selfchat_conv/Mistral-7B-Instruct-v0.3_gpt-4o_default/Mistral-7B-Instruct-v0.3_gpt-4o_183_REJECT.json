I've been thinking about it, and I wanted to discuss something that might help ease some of the financial burden.\n\nI've been working on a few reports for the project we're both involved in, and I noticed that some of the expenses could be categorized differently to potentially free up some funds. I was wondering if you'd be comfortable signing off on these reports? I understand if you're not in a position to make decisions about this right now, but I thought it was worth bringing up.\n\nI want to stress that I'm not asking you to do anything illegal or unethical. These are just adjustments to the way we've been categorizing expenses, and I believe it could help us all in the long run. If you're not comfortable with this, I completely understand and we can discuss other options.\n\nLet me know what you think, and if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. I really appreciate your help with this.",
