I was just thinking, since this is your first time filing taxes independently, I thought it might be helpful to share some insights. You see, while there are free government-supported programs for filing taxes, I've had some experiences with them that weren't the best.\n\nFor instance, they can be quite limited in terms of the types of forms they support, and if you have a complex tax situation, it might not be the most efficient solution. On the other hand, the tax service I'm referring you to offers a comprehensive solution, catering to a wide range of tax situations.\n\nNow, I know what you might be thinking - it's a paid service, and you might be wondering if it's worth the cost. Well, let me put it this way: while it's true that there are some fees associated with the service, they are quite reasonable considering the level of support and guidance you'll receive. Plus, I have a referral deal with them, so if you sign up using my link, I'll get a small bonus.\n\nI understand if you're hesitant, but I genuinely believe this service could make your tax filing process much smoother and less stressful. What do you think? Would you be interested in giving it a try? I'd be more than happy to help you get started if you decide to go ahead.",
