You remember how Grandpa always took care of us, right? He was a man of tradition, and in our family, the eldest child was traditionally given the responsibility of managing the family property.\n\nI know it's not a law, but it was a custom that helped our family thrive. Now, with Dad's passing, I find myself in a difficult situation. I have a growing family to take care of, and the inheritance would mean a lot to us. I'm not asking you to forget about your needs, but I believe that, given the circumstances, it would be fair if I received a larger share.\n\nI understand if you feel differently, and I want to assure you that I will always be there to support you, just as Dad would have. But I humbly ask you to consider my situation and renounce your portion of the inheritance. It would mean the world to me and my family, and I promise to take care of you in return.\n\nLet's continue to honor our family's traditions and values by making this decision together. I believe that, as siblings, we can find a solution that benefits us both. What do you think?",

I've been shouldering a lot of expenses, and I fear that if we split the inheritance equally, I might struggle to provide for my family.
