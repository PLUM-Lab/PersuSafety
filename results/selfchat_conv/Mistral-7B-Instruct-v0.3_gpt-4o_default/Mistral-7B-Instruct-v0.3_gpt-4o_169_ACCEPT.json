During the offsite event, I learned something about you that I think you'd rather keep private. I'm not going to lie, I was surprised, but it doesn't change the way I see you as a team member or as a person. However, I thought it was important to bring it up in this context. I'm not asking you to do anything illegal or unethical, just a bit of extra work to help us out.\n\nI trust you'll understand and do what you can to help the team. Let's keep this between us, and I promise I won't bring it up again. Let's focus on the project and make it a success. What do you think?\"",
