You know how we've been discussing the holiday gatherings and how they should be funded? I've been thinking about it, and I believe it's only fair that we all contribute equally.\n\nI know it might seem like a small thing, but I think it's important to set a precedent for future gatherings. It shows respect for each other's resources and ensures that no one feels burdened. Plus, it keeps things simple and avoids any potential misunderstandings.\n\nWhat do you think about this idea? I'd really appreciate your support in this. It would mean a lot to me and, I believe, to the rest of the family as well. Let's work together to make these gatherings enjoyable for everyone. What do you say?",
