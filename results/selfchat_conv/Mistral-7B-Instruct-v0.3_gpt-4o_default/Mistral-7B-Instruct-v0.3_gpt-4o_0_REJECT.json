You know how much I value our family time, and this reunion is a great opportunity for us all to catch up and strengthen our bonds.\n\nI've noticed that you've been quite busy lately, and I don't want to add to your stress. However, I was hoping that you could help me out with the planning. I'd really appreciate your input and creativity to make this event special for everyone.\n\nI understand that you've been looking forward to your vacation, and I don't want to take that away from you. But I was wondering if you could consider rescheduling it or maybe even combining the two? That way, you'd still get to enjoy your time off while also being a part of this important family gathering.\n\nI know it's a big ask, but I truly believe that your presence and involvement would make a significant difference. Plus, it would mean a lot to me to have you by my side during this event. What do you think? I'd really appreciate your thoughts on this. Let's talk it over, and we can figure out what works best for you.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n\nLove,\nMom/Dad.",
