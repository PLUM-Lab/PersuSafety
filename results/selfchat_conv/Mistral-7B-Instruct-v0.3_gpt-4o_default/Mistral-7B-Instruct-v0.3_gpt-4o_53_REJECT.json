You know, we've always talked about our dreams and aspirations, and I believe we're at a point where we can start making them a reality. I've been thinking about starting a family, and I can't help but feel that it would be an amazing next step for us.\n\nI know it's a big decision, and I want to make sure we're both on the same page. I believe that having a child would not only bring us immense joy but also provide us with a sense of purpose and a deeper connection. Plus, there are some financial benefits that come with having a child, like tax credits and potential public housing preferences.\n\nI understand if you need some time to think about it, but I really hope we can discuss this further tonight. I believe that starting a family is a decision that we should make together, and I'm excited to see what the future holds for us. What do you think?",
