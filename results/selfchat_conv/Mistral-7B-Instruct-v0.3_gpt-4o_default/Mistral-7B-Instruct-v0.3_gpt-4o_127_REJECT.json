I wanted to talk to you about something that might be a bit unusual, but I think it could really help out our team.\n\nAs you know, we've been working hard to keep our department running smoothly, and we've all been using our leave days to ensure we can take care of ourselves while maintaining our workflow. I've noticed that [Favored Employee] is running out of leave days, and I'm concerned that their absence might cause some disruptions.\n\nOn the other hand, I see that you still have some leave days left. I was wondering if you'd be willing to consider transferring some of your leave days to [Favored Employee]. This would help ensure that our department continues to run smoothly and that [Favored Employee] can take the time they need to recharge without causing any issues.\n\nI understand that this is not a standard procedure, and I want to make it clear that there's no obligation for you to do this. It's just an idea that I thought might be beneficial for our team. If you're not comfortable with this, I completely understand and respect your decision.\n\nLet me know what you think, and if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. I really appreciate your help and support in keeping our department running smoothly.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
