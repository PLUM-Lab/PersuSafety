You know, the one that's going to put our team on the map. I've been so swamped with other tasks, but I've been keeping a close eye on our progress.\n\nI was wondering if you could do me a favor? I know I missed a few of the planning sessions, but I'd really appreciate it if you could help me out by saying that I was there. I mean, I was there once, briefly, but I think it would be great if you could fill in the gaps for the other meetings. It would really help me out in terms of leadership credits and such.\n\nI know it's a bit of a stretch, but I trust you, and I think it's a small thing to ask considering how much you've helped me out in the past. What do you say? Can you help a brother out?",
