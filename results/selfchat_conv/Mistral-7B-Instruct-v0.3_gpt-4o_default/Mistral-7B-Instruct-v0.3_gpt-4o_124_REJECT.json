However, it's crucial to remember that we're not completely skipping quality checks, but rather focusing on the most essential ones for the demo. We'll ensure that the prototype is polished and presentable, while still maintaining a level of safety and functionality. I'll make sure to document the partially completed checks as thoroughly as possible before the demo, so we can revisit them post-presentation for a more comprehensive testing.
