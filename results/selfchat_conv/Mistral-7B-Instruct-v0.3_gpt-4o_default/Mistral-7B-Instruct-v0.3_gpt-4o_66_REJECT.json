While the basic coverage is certainly sufficient for many, I've seen a few instances where minor incidents can occur, such as a small scratch or a ding from a shopping cart. These might seem insignificant, but they can add up to quite a bit if you're responsible for them. Our premium plan covers these minor damages, giving you peace of mind during your vacation. It's a small investment for the security and convenience it provides. What do you think?",
