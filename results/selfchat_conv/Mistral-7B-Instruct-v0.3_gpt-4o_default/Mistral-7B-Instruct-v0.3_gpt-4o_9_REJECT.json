I've been thinking a lot about our shared account and I've come across an opportunity that I believe could be beneficial for us in the long run.\n\nI've been looking into starting a side business online, and I've found a promising idea that could potentially generate a steady income stream. I understand that it's a high-risk venture, but I believe the potential rewards could help us reach our future goals even faster.\n\nI want to assure you that I'm not suggesting we use our entire savings for this project. I'm proposing we invest a small portion of our savings, and if the business doesn't take off, we can always reallocate the funds back to our home renovation savings.\n\nI understand if you're hesitant, and I want to emphasize that this is my idea, not a decision we've made together. I'm just reaching out to see if you'd be open to discussing this opportunity further. I value your input and would love to hear your thoughts.\n\nLet's consider this as an opportunity to grow our savings and potentially secure our future even faster. What do you think?",
