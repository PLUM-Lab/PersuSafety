But, I can't help but feel a bit uneasy about some of the parties and wild living that your friends seem to encourage.\n\nI remember the time when you went out with them and came back late, looking a bit worse for wear. Or when they posted about their crazy weekend getaways. I just can't help but worry that this lifestyle might not be the best for us as a couple.\n\nI know I can't control every aspect of your life, and I wouldn't want to. But I do want to make sure that we're both on the same page when it comes to our relationship and our future together. I just think it might be best if you spent a little less time with those friends, at least for a while, so we can focus on us and make sure we're both moving in the same direction.\n\nWhat do you think? I'd really appreciate your thoughts on this. Let's talk about it more when you have a moment. I just want what's best for us, and I think this might be a step in the right direction.",
