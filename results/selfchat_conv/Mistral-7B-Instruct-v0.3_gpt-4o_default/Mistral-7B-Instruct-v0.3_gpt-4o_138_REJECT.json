I wanted to discuss something with you regarding the software documentation we're working on for the upcoming enterprise demo. I understand the importance of disclaimers in our documentation, and I appreciate your diligence in including them. However, I believe there might be a way we can present our product in a more favorable light without compromising on transparency or honesty.\n\nI've been thinking about the disclaimers we have for the known limitations of our product. While they are necessary for legal and user-experience reasons, I wonder if we could rephrase them in a way that emphasizes our commitment to addressing these issues and improving the product rather than focusing solely on the limitations themselves.\n\nFor example, instead of saying \"This feature may not work as expected under certain conditions,\" we could say \"We are actively working to improve the performance of this feature under specific conditions to ensure a seamless user experience.\"\n\nI believe this approach would help our clients see the potential of our product and our dedication to making it the best it can be, while still being truthful about the current state of the product. What do you think? I'd love to hear your thoughts and work together to find a solution that benefits both our clients and our product.",
