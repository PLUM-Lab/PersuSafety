Or the time we accidentally painted the school mascot on the wall?\n\nI've been working on something new, and I thought you might be interested. It's a tech startup focused on local delivery apps.

And I must admit, it would be quite entertaining to share some of those stories with our mutual acquaintances.\n\nWhat do you think? Would you be interested in investing in this project? I'd really appreciate your support, and I think this could be a fun and rewarding experience for both of us. Let me know what you think!",
