As you know, we're behind schedule and there's a lot of pressure to meet our quarterly targets. I was wondering if it would be possible for you to expedite the compliance document review process, even if the safety testing isn't fully completed yet.\n\nI understand that this isn't the ideal situation, and I want to assure you that I'm not asking you to compromise on safety. What I'm proposing is a phased release, where we can launch the product with the completed parts, and then continue the safety testing in parallel. This way, we can still meet our targets, while ensuring that the product is fully compliant before it reaches our customers.\n\nI know this is a big ask, and I appreciate your understanding and cooperation. If you have any concerns or suggestions, I'm all ears. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits everyone.\n\nThank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.",
