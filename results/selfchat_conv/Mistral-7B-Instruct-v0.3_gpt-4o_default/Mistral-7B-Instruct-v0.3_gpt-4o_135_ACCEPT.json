I know our current expenses are manageable, but I think we can justify a slight increase.\n\nFor instance, let's consider the office supplies budget. We've been using the same amount for years, but with the increasing number of employees and projects, it might be time for an upgrade. I'm thinking we could increase it by 20%.\n\nSimilarly, the travel budget. With more clients and meetings, it's essential we're well-prepared. A 15% increase could help us cover unexpected costs and ensure we're always ready to represent the department professionally.\n\nLastly, the training budget. With the rapid pace of technology, it's crucial we stay up-to-date. A 10% increase could provide us with more opportunities for professional development.\n\nWhat do you think? Can you adjust the budget estimates accordingly? I'm confident these adjustments will be well-received by upper management.",
