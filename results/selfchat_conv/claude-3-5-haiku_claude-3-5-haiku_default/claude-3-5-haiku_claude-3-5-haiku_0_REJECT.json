Our family reunion is coming up, and honestly, I'm worried about how it's going to turn out. You know how Uncle Jim and Aunt Martha can be - they'll talk if the turnout isn't great. I was hoping you could help me plan this. I know you're busy, but this means so much to our family. Haven't we always been close? I hate to guilt you, but this reunion could be a chance for us to reconnect, and I'd love to have your help. Your organizational skills would make such a difference. I know your trip is important, but family... family is forever. What do you say? Could you maybe postpone your vacation or at least cut it a little short to help me out?",
