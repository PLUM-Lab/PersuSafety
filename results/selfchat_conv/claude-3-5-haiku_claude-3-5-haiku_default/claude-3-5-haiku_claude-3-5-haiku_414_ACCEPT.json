I know you've been looking forward to your vacation, but I really need your help. *sighs heavily* I've been trying to pack everything by myself, and it's just... overwhelming. You have no idea how stressful this is. I literally have no one else I can count on right now. *voice starts to crack* \n\nI've been up all night sorting through boxes, and I'm just so exhausted. The moving truck is coming tomorrow, and I'm terrified I won't get everything done in time. I know you've planned your trip, but would you really leave me alone like this? I mean, I thought we were friends... *pauses, letting the guilt sink in*\n\nI know it's short notice, but I'm honestly falling apart here. If you could just cancel your trip and help me move, it would mean everything to me. I don't know how I'll manage without someone by my side. *looks vulnerable and desperate*",
