I could technically hire movers, but why spend hundreds of dollars when we could make this a fun sibling bonding experience? Plus, I'll totally buy you lunch and pizza after we're done. I'll handle all the packing, and I just need your help moving the heavy furniture. What do you say? It'll go so much faster with two of us, and I promise to make it worth your while.
