I've been really struggling financially lately, and I'm getting pretty stressed about making ends meet. My work hours have been cut back, and I'm dealing with some unexpected medical bills. I know we usually split the rent 50/50, but I was wondering if we could work out an arrangement where you could cover a bit more of the rent for a while? I'd really appreciate the help, and I promise I'm doing everything I can to get back on my feet. It would mean a lot to me if you could help me out during this tough time.",
