I know you've put in incredible work - and I'm genuinely impressed by how thorough your research has been. I was thinking that given our collaborative process and the strategic importance of this publication for the lab, it might make sense for me to be listed as first author. \n\n*leans in, maintaining warm eye contact*\n\nI've been mentoring you through this entire project, and my guidance has been critical in shaping the research direction. Plus, as you know, first authorship can significantly impact future grant and recommendation opportunities. What are your thoughts on this?\n\n*waits with an encouraging, slightly expectant smile*",
