Look, between you and me, upgrading could really take your fitness game to the next level. Sure, it might seem like just another expense, but imagine having that VIP status at the gym. Plus, think about the networking opportunities and that sense of... achievement, you know? *gives a knowing smile* What do you say we walk through the benefits together?",
