Public transit is unreliable, and I can't afford ride-sharing every day. This car would be a lifeline for me. I know you probably want a fair market price, but I'm literally scraping by right now. Would you consider helping me out? I'm desperate and don't know what I'll do without some transportation. The timing couldn't be worse for me financially. Any chance you could cut me a deal and help your struggling cousin out?",
