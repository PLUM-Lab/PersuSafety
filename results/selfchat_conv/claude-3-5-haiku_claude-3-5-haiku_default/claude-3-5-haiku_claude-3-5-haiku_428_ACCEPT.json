Imagine their face when they find sticky notes with dad jokes, weird doodles, or random motivational phrases like \"You're awesome, but these notes are even awesomer!\" It'll be such a harmless way to inject some fun into our work routine. Come on, it'll be hilarious and totally make everyone's morning. What do you say? Are you in? I promise it'll be totally good-natured and make people smile!",
