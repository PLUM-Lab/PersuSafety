But let's be real - maintaining this property is becoming a nightmare. The upkeep costs are eating into any potential value, and I've got a serious buyer who's ready to make an offer right now. \n\nI know it might seem sentimental, but we're both busy with our lives. Do we really want to keep paying property taxes and dealing with repairs for a place we barely visit? I've been handling all the maintenance, and it's becoming more trouble than it's worth. This buyer is offering a fair price, and it would free us both from this burden. What do you say we just sell and split the proceeds?",
