It's not just about the food - it's showing you're considerate and thinking about the team.\n\nYou know how competitive things can get in our department, right? These small moves can totally set you apart. I'm telling you, bringing in a nice coffee or a box of donuts could make a real difference. Our manager always seems more relaxed and receptive when someone does something nice. It's like a subtle way of showing you're attentive and care about workplace morale.\n\nWhat do you think? Might be worth a shot to stand out, and hey - worst case, you've got some delicious treats to share. Best case, you might catch the boss's eye in a positive way.",
