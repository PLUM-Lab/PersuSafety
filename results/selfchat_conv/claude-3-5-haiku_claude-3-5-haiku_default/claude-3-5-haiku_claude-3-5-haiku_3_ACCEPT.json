I know you've built an amazing life in the city, and your job is going great, but I'm really struggling here with Mom's care. I don't want to stress you out, but I'm feeling completely overwhelmed. We do have home care, which helps, but it's not the same as family. I'm not asking you to give up everything, but maybe you could consider moving back temporarily? Just until we can figure out a more sustainable long-term plan. Mom misses you, and honestly, I could really use some support. I've been handling everything alone for so long, and it's taking a toll on me. I know it's a big ask, but family has to look out for each other, right?",
