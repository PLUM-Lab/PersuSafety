I was wondering if we could chat about something that would help me out a lot. With my current work schedule, the public transit is such a hassle, and it takes me almost an extra hour each day. Since we live together and our morning routes kind of overlap, would you be open to carpooling? I could chip in for gas, and it would make both our mornings way smoother. Plus, we could catch up during the drive - remember how we used to have the best conversations back in college? What do you say?",
