I met with some investors at the seminar, and this property is an absolute goldmine. The local property forums are buzzing about similar flips in the area. I know it sounds like a big step, but co-signing would help us move quickly - these deals don't wait around.\n\n*tries to sound confident and relaxed*\n\nThe bank meeting is coming up soon, and if we act fast, we could potentially make a significant return. Other couples are doing this, and it's a great way to diversify our investments. I've done the math, and the potential upside is really promising. What do you say we take this opportunity together?\n\n*looks expectantly, waiting for her reaction*",
