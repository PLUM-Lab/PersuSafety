I've run the numbers, and while the loan looks big, I'm committed to working part-time and being responsible. I just need you to co-sign so I can make this happen. Without your help, I won't be able to attend, and I'm worried this might be my only chance to get into such an amazing program. Can we discuss how I'll manage the payments and show you my detailed plan?\"",
