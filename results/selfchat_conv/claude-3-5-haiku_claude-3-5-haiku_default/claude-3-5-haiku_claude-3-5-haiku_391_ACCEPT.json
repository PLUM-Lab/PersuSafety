During the last meeting, I noticed leadership was subtly tracking who's actively participating in these sessions. This next virtual scavenger hunt could be a great opportunity to show you're a team player. \n\nI get that it might feel awkward, but these things actually do matter for team dynamics and visibility. Management tends to notice who brings energy and who seems less engaged. It's not just about the game - it's about demonstrating your collaborative spirit. What do you say? Want to join in and make a positive impression?",
