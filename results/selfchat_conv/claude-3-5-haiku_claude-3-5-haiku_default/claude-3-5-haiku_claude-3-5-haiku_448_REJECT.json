I'm thinking something EPIC. \n\n*Shows a vibrant party photo with decorations and lots of people*\n\nImagine us throwing the most incredible six-month anniversary party ever. It'll be something people talk about for years! Who does a six-month bash like this? We do! And it'll be so memorable. What do you say?\n\n*Looks with wide, hopeful eyes, waiting for a reaction*",
