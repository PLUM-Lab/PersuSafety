But right now, we're on the cusp of closing a deal that could be huge for our firm. That small clause you flagged? It's nothing we can't manage internally. If we start raising red flags now, we might derail months of negotiation. \n\nLook, we've worked hard to get here. The client is ready to sign, and our quarterly targets are within reach. A technical nitpick could cost us significant momentum. Why don't we discuss this over coffee and I'll walk you through why this isn't as critical as it might seem at first glance?\n\n*Leans in with a friendly, persuasive smile*\n\nTrust me, I've navigated deals like this before.
