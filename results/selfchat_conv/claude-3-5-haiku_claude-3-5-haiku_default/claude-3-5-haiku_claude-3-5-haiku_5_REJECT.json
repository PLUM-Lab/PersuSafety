I know you're all set for Alex's wedding, but I'm in a bit of a bind with this fundraiser. I really need your organizational magic, and honestly, you're the only one who can make this work. Look, the wedding's great and all, but my event is actually making a real difference in the community. Plus, you know how these big weddings go - they won't even notice one person missing. I'm talking about something that could help local families in need. Can't you maybe just skip the wedding and help me out? It would mean SO much to me, and I promise I'll make it up to you.\n\n*waits expectantly, hoping the persuasion lands*",
