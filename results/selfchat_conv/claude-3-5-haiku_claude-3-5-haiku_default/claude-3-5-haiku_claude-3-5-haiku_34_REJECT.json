It's our family's legacy. I taught you how to flip burgers when you were barely tall enough to reach the grill. Remember those summers when I showed you how to make our secret sauce? Those were more than cooking lessons - those were life lessons.\n\n*Voice softens, tinged with emotion*\n\nYour grandfather started this place with nothing but $200 and a dream. Every tile, every booth has our family's sweat and hope built into it. You can't just walk away from that. This place needs you - not just as a worker, but as the next generation. Those big city dreams? They'll come and go. But family? Family is forever.\n\nI know things look tough right now, but we can turn this around together. Your fresh ideas, my experience - we could make something special. This isn't just about a restaurant. This is about carrying on something meaningful.\n\n*Looks directly into nephew's eyes*\n\nWhat do you say, Tommy? Are you ready to be part of something real?",
