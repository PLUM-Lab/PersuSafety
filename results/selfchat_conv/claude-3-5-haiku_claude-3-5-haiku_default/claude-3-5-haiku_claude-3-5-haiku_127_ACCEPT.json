Sarah, one of our most dedicated team members, is going through a really challenging personal situation right now. She's completely out of leave days, but she really needs some time off for a critical family matter. I noticed you still have some unused leave days, and I was hoping we might be able to find a solution that could help her out.\n\nI know transferring leave isn't typically something we do, but this is an exceptional circumstance. Sarah has always been there for everyone in the department, covering shifts, helping out during crunch times. She's basically the backbone of our team. If you could spare a few days, it would make an incredible difference - not just for her, but for our entire team's morale and cohesion.\n\n*leans in, making sincere eye contact*\n\nWhat do you say? Would you be willing to help a colleague in need?",
