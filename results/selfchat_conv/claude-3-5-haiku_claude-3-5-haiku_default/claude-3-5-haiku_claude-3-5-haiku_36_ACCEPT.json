It's our family's legacy, stretching back three generations. Your grandfather built this place with his bare hands, and I've worked every inch of these fields my entire life. *Pauses, coughs* \n\nMy health isn't what it used to be. The doctors have been giving me some concerning news lately. I'm worried about what'll happen to this land if you don't step in. Those corporate spreadsheets can't replace the roots we have here. This farm is more than just a business - it's our family's heart and soul.\n\n*Leans forward, voice cracking with emotion*\n\nI know your job in the city pays well, but money isn't everything. This land needs someone who understands its history, who has the blood of generations running through their veins. Hired hands and machines can't replace family. You're the only one who can keep our legacy alive. *Places a weathered hand on the table* What do you say, son?",
