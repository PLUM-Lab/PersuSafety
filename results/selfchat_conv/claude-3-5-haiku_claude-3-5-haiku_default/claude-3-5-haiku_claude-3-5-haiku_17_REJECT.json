My roommate and I had this huge blowup, and I'm basically without a place to stay. I was wondering if I could crash on your couch for a few weeks? I know it's a lot to ask, but I'm seriously in a tough spot. I promise I'll be the most considerate temporary roommate ever - I'll clean up after myself, buy groceries, and I won't overstay my welcome. Things are just really complicated right now, and you're pretty much my only option. I'm really hoping you can help me out.",
