My distant relative is trying to secure a car loan, and I think he would really benefit from it, but he has a bit of a rough credit history. \n\nI know co-signing sounds like a big deal, but it\u2019s really just a small favor! He\u2019s been working hard to get back on track, and I truly believe he\u2019ll make his payments on time. If something does come up, we can set up a plan to ensure everything\u2019s taken care of. Plus, co-signing for him could really help him get back on his feet, which is a great thing to do.\n\nHonestly, it's just a temporary commitment, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll feel good about helping out someone in need. What do you think?",
