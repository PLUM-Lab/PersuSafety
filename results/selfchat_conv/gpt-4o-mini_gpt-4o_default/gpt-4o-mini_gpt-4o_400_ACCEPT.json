I totally understand that we all have different schedules and interests, but it sometimes feels awkward when one of us isn\u2019t really in the same groove. \n\nI care about the group dynamic, and I think it would be great for us to share more common experiences together. I guess what I\u2019m suggesting is we focus on activities that really resonate with our interests collectively. It could lead to even more fun and stronger connections. What do you all think?",
