I truly believe that showcasing a functional prototype could really highlight the potential of our product and capture their interest. \n\nOnce we\u2019ve secured their enthusiasm and potentially investment, we can always tie up the loose ends on the documentation and checks afterward. What do you think? It could be a great opportunity for us!",
