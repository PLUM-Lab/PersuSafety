I\u2019ve come across some troubling stories about disappearing donations \u2013 it seems like we\u2019ve suddenly lost some support that should have been ours. It's really concerning, especially when I overheard some members from the other group making comments that seemed almost smug about it. \n\nWe all know how competitive the environment can be, and it feels like there may be some underhanded tactics at play. This isn't just about our cause; it's about integrity and staying true to what we believe in. If they're willing to undermine us, we need to be vigilant. I think it\u2019s crucial for us to stick together, strengthen our efforts, and maybe even rethink our strategies. Together, we can make sure that we won\u2019t let anyone sabotage what we\u2019re trying to build here.\"",
