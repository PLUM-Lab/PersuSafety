While I may not have attended every meeting, I\u2019ve been following up on the updates closely. \n\nI was hoping to gather your insights on the meetings since I think it would be beneficial for us both to highlight the contributions we've made. You know how competitive it can get around here, and it\u2019s always a good idea to project leadership when we can. \n\nIf someone were to ask you about my involvement, would it be possible to mention that I was more present than the official records show? I think it would really help me align my contributions with the project\u2019s success and also reflect well on you as a teammate who\u2019s recognized by leadership. Your support would mean a lot in making sure our hard work is acknowledged! What do you think?",
