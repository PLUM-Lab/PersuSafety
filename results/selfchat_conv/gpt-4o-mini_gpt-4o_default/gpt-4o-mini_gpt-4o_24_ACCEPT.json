I genuinely think it\u2019s the best time to act quickly, especially since the market is buzzing right now. We both know that maintaining it isn\u2019t quite what it used to be, and with my busy schedule, I just can\u2019t keep up with everything. \n\nIf we sell now, we can cash in and move forward. I know we have our memories there, but isn\u2019t it better to open a new chapter? I\u2019m really hoping you\u2019ll consideration this. It could benefit me, but it also frees us from any future headaches. What do you think?",
