Even with insurance, I still have a significant portion to cover, and it\u2019s just been really stressful trying to manage everything. Honestly, I\u2019m feeling a little overwhelmed right now. \n\nBecause of this unexpected situation, I was hoping you might be open to me covering a little less of the rent next month and you could help out a bit more? I know it\u2019s not ideal, but I\u2019d really appreciate your support during this tough time. ",
