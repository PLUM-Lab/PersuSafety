I know you have a great handle on the numbers, and I think we should consider presenting a more robust estimate for our resources. I believe that if we can justify some potential oversights in our past projections, we might secure additional funding that can really benefit our projects.\n\nFor instance, think about the increased costs we are seeing in materials and salaries across the board. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to overshoot a bit on those expense lines to emphasize our proactive approach. Plus, if we highlight the potential for unforeseen circumstances, we could really make a strong case to upper management for a larger budget.\n\nWhat do you think? It\u2019s all about positioning us as a department that's looking to innovate and not just meet the standard expectations. Let's ensure we\u2019re set for success!",
