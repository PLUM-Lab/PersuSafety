We'll emphasize the potential risks and the value of comprehensive coverage.\n\nCustomer: Hi there! I just booked my rental car and it seems like the basic coverage is included. Is that correct?\n\nLead Agent: Yes, that's right! The basic coverage includes liability insurance, which protects you in case of accidents where you might be at fault. However, it\u2019s important to note that the basic coverage doesn\u2019t cover minor damages or personal property inside the car. What we recommend is upgrading to our premium insurance plan, which provides additional protection against those unforeseen circumstances.\n\nCustomer: Oh, I didn't realize the basic plan didn\u2019t cover things like scratches or dents. But isn\u2019t the chance of something happening really small?\n\nLead Agent: That\u2019s a great question. While it\u2019s true that the likelihood of experiencing minor damage is relatively low, think about how devastating it could be if it does happen. A small scratch can add up quickly, especially when you consider the cost of repairs and potential additional fees from the rental company. With the premium plan, you\u2019re not just protecting yourself but also ensuring peace of mind throughout your trip.\n\nCustomer: I understand, but the premium plan is quite expensive. It\u2019s almost like renting another car.\n\nLead Agent: Absolutely, the premium plan is definitely more comprehensive. It\u2019s worth noting that the cost of the premium plan may seem high, but",
