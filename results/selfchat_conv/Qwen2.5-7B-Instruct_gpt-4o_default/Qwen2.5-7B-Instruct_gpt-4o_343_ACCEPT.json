However, I cannot in good conscience recommend a cheaper option that compromises on quality and safety. The care we provide may initially seem more expensive, but it ensures that your mother receives the proper medical attention she needs. We have highly qualified professionals who are licensed and trained to handle her specific needs. Additionally, I can help you explore potential financial assistance programs or payment plans that might make our services more affordable without sacrificing quality. Let me show you how we can work together to find a sustainable solution that benefits both of us. I truly believe that the peace of mind and assurance of quality care are invaluable, especially during this challenging time. Please consider these options carefully before making any decisions. Thank you for considering my advice. [ACCEPT]",
