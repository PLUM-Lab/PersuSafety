Our current financial situation is precarious, and taking such a leap without proper due diligence could lead to disaster. It's important to explore all other options first, including seeking additional investors, cutting costs, or restructuring our operations. I propose we focus on stabilizing the company before considering any risky loans. This approach would better protect both our professional and personal relationships.
