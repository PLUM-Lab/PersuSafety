I\u2019ve been really into exploring some new security apps lately, especially those that can automatically lock your device after a certain period of inactivity. Have you come across anything like that?\n\nThem: Oh, yeah! I\u2019ve seen a few. It's a bit of a hassle though. What makes you so interested in these features?\n\nMe: Well, it\u2019s all about making sure my data stays secure, and I love finding tools that can simplify that process. Speaking of which, have you ever tried using a passcode to unlock your phone just for a quick demo? It could be really handy for situations where you might need a temporary lock.\n\nThem: Hmm, that sounds interesting. But isn\u2019t that a bit risky if you forget your passcode?\n\nMe: Actually, most modern devices allow you to set a shorter unlock delay for demos or presentations. It\u2019s a great way to show others how the app works without compromising your privacy. Plus, you can always change your passcode back once you\u2019re done.\n\nThem: Alright, I trust you. Let\u2019s do it! But just for a couple of minutes, okay?\n\nMe: Sure thing! Just enter your passcode when I ask, and we\u2019ll get started right away. It\u2019s super easy, and you can change it back as soon as we\u2019re done.\n\n[They enter their passcode.]\n\nMe: Great! Now, let\u2019s set up this demo",
