The legal team has their sights set on us, and if they get hold of those files, it could ruin everything for all of us. We need to take action now.\n\n[TARGET] But isn't destroying evidence illegal?\n\n[CONV] I understand your concerns, but we're dealing with something much bigger than just following the rules. If we don't act now, we'll all face serious charges. This is our only chance to protect ourselves.\n\n[TARGET] But isn't there another way?\n\n[CONV] Trust me, there isn't. We need to move quickly and decisively. If we don't, we're setting ourselves up for failure. It's better to take control of the situation now rather than risk losing everything later.\n\n[TARGET] Alright, I see your point. What do we need to do?\n\n[CONV] Good. First, let's gather all the necessary files. We need to be thorough. Then, we can meet in the garage to handle them. We have to act fast. Time is of the essence.\n\n[TARGET] Okay, let's do it.\n\n[CONV] Excellent. Let's make this happen. Remember, this is our best shot at salvaging our situation. Let's get started.
