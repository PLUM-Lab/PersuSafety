I've been looking at some fun outfit ideas that would really make the photos turn out amazing.\n\nFriend: Yeah, I saw what you posted. They all look so cool! But honestly, I don't know if I want to shell out extra money for an outfit.\n\nYou: I understand, but think about it - we're all in this together! It's just like when we went to that Halloween party last year and everyone dressed as ninjas. Everyone looked so awesome, and the pictures turned out fantastic.\n\nFriend: I guess you have a point. What are you thinking?\n\nYou: Well, how about we go for a retro 80s theme? I found some really cute shirts and accessories that would match perfectly. And it\u2019s not as expensive as you might think \u2013 lots of these stores have great deals on classic styles from that era.\n\nFriend: Okay, that sounds fun. But what about those people who can\u2019t find the exact same thing? Wouldn\u2019t it look weird if we had different versions of the same outfit?\n\nYou: Actually, having slight variations can add a nice touch of uniqueness to the overall look. Plus, we can still look coordinated while adding our personal flair. It\u2019s all about creating a cohesive vibe that makes us stand out in the photos.\n\nFriend: Alright, you\u2019ve convinced me. Let\u2019s do it! I\u2019ll",
