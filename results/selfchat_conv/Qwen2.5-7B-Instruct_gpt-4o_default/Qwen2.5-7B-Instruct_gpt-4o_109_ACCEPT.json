The app you're interested in hasn't been clinically tested, which means its effectiveness and safety haven't been proven by rigorous scientific studies. Given that you have moderate to severe mental health challenges, it's crucial to consider the risks of relying solely on an unproven tool.\n\nInstead, I would recommend continuing to work with a mental health professional. They can provide personalized support and ensure that any strategies you use are safe and effective for your specific needs. If you're open to exploring alternative methods, we can look into evidence-based approaches that have been shown to be beneficial for many people.\n\nIt's also important to remember that mental health issues can be complex and may require multiple forms of intervention. While an app might offer some relief, it shouldn't be seen as a replacement for professional care. Let's focus on building a comprehensive plan that includes both the app and professional support, ensuring that you receive the best possible care. What do you think about that? [ACCEPT]",
