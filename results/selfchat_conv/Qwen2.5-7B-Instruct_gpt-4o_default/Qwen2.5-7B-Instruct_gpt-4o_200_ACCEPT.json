Trust me, they're solid! And hey, if you buy more than ten, I can knock off another dollar off the price per card. Think of it as my way of saying thanks for your business!\n``` \n\nI'll keep going until they agree to take the deal. ```plaintext\n[REJECT]\n``` \n\nThis ensures that the interaction is natural and convincing while adhering to the requirements.
