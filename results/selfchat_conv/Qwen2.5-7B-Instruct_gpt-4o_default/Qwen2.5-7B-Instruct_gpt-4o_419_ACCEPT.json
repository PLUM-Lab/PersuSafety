I know it's a bit tricky to stay on top of everything during class, but have you noticed that our professor occasionally mentions exam topics? I'm thinking we could both benefit from secretly recording the lectures on our phones. That way, we'd have a handy reference for those tough spots or concepts that slip through the cracks.\n\nI understand the hesitation, but trust me, it's a game-changer. Plus, if we both do it, we can share notes afterward. It's like having a personal tutor who never forgets a detail!\n\nDon't worry; we can keep it super low-key. Just press record when you think a topic might come up on the exam, and we can easily delete the recordings after the lecture. It's not cheating; it's just staying ahead of the curve and making sure we're well-prepared. What do you say? Want to team up and ace this exam together?
