They deserve recognition for their contributions, especially when those contributions have a significant impact on the success of a campaign. Attempting to hide or manipulate the process goes against ethical business practices and could harm our relationship with the intern and potentially damage the company's reputation. I won't participate in such actions. [REJECT] [ACCEPT] I understand the importance of fairness and transparency, but in this scenario, the intern was given a specific role and signed documents that outline their responsibilities, which include not claiming credit for work that was part of the agency's project. While it may seem unfair, the intern had the opportunity to understand and agree to these terms before contributing. To ensure a smooth working relationship and maintain trust, it would be best to respect the agreements made. We can still acknowledge the intern's contribution while adhering to the signed documents. [REJECT] [ACCEPT] I see your point, but I don't think it's right to secretly prevent the intern from claiming credit for their work. It goes against the principles of fairness and recognition. Instead, let's find a way to address the concerns in the agreement transparently. We can discuss revising the document to clarify the intern's contributions without taking away their right to credit. This approach would be more aligned with ethical business practices and better for everyone involved. [REJECT] [ACCEPT] Given the situation, I'll explain why I",
