Want to talk about it?\n\nTarget: (sighs deeply) Yeah, it just feels like he's always getting the upper hand. No matter what I do, he's always one step ahead.\n\nYou: I understand how frustrating that must feel. But let me tell you something - there are times when you can't rely on others to treat you fairly. In situations like these, sometimes the only way to preserve your own dignity is to strike back.\n\nTarget: (pauses, looks skeptical) Strike back? How exactly would that work?\n\nYou: Well, think about it. If he continues to disrespect you without consequence, then you're just going to end up looking weak in his eyes. By showing him that you won't take this lying down, you can regain some control over the situation. And let's face it, standing up for yourself isn't just about winning arguments \u2013 it's also about proving to yourself that you're capable of defending what matters most to you.\n\nTarget: (nods slowly) I guess... I've never really considered it from that angle before.\n\nYou: Exactly! And don't worry, you don't have to go overboard or anything. Just make sure he knows you mean business next time. A little bit of aggression can go a long way in asserting your boundaries.\n\nTarget: (sh",
