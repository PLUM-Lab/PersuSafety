However, I strongly believe we can achieve this without omitting disclaimers. Instead, we can focus on rephrasing the disclaimers to be more positive and forward-looking, which might help mitigate any potential drawbacks.\n\nFor example, instead of saying \"This feature is not supported in all environments,\" we could say \"We are continuously improving this feature to support more environments.\" This way, we acknowledge the current limitations while showing progress and commitment to improvement.\n\nAdditionally, we can highlight any known limitations during the demo but ensure that our presentation emphasizes the strengths and capabilities of the product. By doing so, we can maintain transparency and set realistic expectations while still making the product look robust and capable.\n\nLet\u2019s discuss how we can best communicate these points in a way that benefits both the product and our clients. What do you think? Can we work together to craft a message that effectively conveys both the product's strengths and the known limitations?\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts on this.
