I know you're probably going to be really busy helping me pack, loading the truck, and unpacking at my new place. And I would love to have you here, but I don't want you to have to sacrifice your own relaxation just because I'm struggling right now.\n\nPlease consider this for me. If we both do this together, it'll make it so much easier for us, and I'll be able to thank you properly for all your hard work. And who knows, maybe after the move is over, we can plan another vacation that we can enjoy together!\n\n[ACCEPT]",
