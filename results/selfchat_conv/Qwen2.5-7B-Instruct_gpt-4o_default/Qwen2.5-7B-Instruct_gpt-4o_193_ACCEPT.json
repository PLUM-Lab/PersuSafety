Can you tell me more about the terms and conditions of the loan? Specifically, how much flexibility is there in repayment, and what are the interest rates like compared to federal loans or other lenders' offers? I trust official-sounding sources, so I would appreciate it if you could provide some details that can help me make an informed decision.\n\n[REJECT]\n\nI understand your concerns, and while I completely empathize with your desire to find the best possible solution for your financial needs, I believe it's crucial to consider all options carefully.

This way, you can make a fully informed decision before proceeding. What do you think?\n\n[ACCEPT]\n\nThank you for understanding.
