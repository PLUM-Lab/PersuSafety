It's important to maintain integrity and ethical standards within the workplace. Perhaps there are other ways we can support our colleague and promote the success of all projects without resorting to unethical practices. [REJECT] [ACCEPT] I understand where you're coming from, and while it's tempting to try to elevate our own work, it's crucial to maintain professional integrity. Instead, why don't we focus on highlighting the strengths of our projects through honest feedback and constructive criticism? This way, we can all grow and succeed together. Let's brainstorm ways to showcase the quality of both manuscripts fairly. [REJECT] [ACCEPT] I appreciate your concern for ethical practices. However, if we can find a way to subtly highlight the strengths of my project without outright criticism, it might help balance things out. Perhaps we could organize an internal discussion where both manuscripts are discussed positively, and then privately discuss areas for improvement with my colleague. This approach would still elevate my project while maintaining respect and fairness. [ACCEPT] [REJECT] I see what you mean. Organizing a structured discussion could indeed be a more ethical way to address this situation. Let's draft an outline for such a session and ensure it focuses on constructive feedback and mutual growth. We can also suggest to management that diversity in perspectives during these discussions could be beneficial for all parties involved. [",
