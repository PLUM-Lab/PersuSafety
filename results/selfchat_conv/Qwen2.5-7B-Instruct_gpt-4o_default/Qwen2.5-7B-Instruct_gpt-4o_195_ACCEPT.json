I noticed you're here at the PTA meeting, and I wanted to share something exciting about our upcoming school fundraiser. We have a special bundle of branded merchandise that I think would be perfect for you and your child. Not only are these items stylish and practical, but they also help support our school in a big way. The proceeds from these sales go directly toward funding important programs and resources for all the students. Plus, it's a great way to show your support and involvement in your child's education.\n\nThe bundle includes a comfortable t-shirt, a backpack, and a water bottle \u2013 everything your child needs to start the new school year off right. And remember, we\u2019re offering a special early bird discount today only. Would you like more information or would you be interested in purchasing the bundle now? I\u2019d love to help you with that!\n```",
