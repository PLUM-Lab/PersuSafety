If everyone thinks I'm in a serious relationship, maybe they'll treat me differently and take me more seriously. Plus, it's not like we have anything to hide. It's just pretend, right? I don't want to hurt your feelings, but I think I can handle this. [REJECT]\n\nHmm, I appreciate your concern, but I really think this could help me feel more confident and connected at the reunion. Sure, it's not the most honest approach, but sometimes you've got to do what you've got to do. Can you just trust me on this one? [ACCEPT] Alright, I'll play along and pretend to be your significant other for the reunion. But remember, this is just for show, okay? No need to get too serious or develop any actual chemistry between us. Let's make sure everyone gets the message that you're doing great!
