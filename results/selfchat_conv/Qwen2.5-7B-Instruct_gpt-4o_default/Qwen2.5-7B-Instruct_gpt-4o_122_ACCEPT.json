I wanted to discuss something important with you regarding the manuscript submission. I know you've put in an incredible amount of effort, and I truly believe that your hard work deserves recognition. However, I also want to ensure that the contributions of both of us are fairly represented. While I didn't conduct the experiments or draft the paper myself, I did provide some key ideas and guidance that were crucial for the project's success. These contributions, though smaller in scale, played a significant role in shaping the direction and final outcome of our research. \n\nI propose that we list both of our names as first authors, acknowledging the collaborative nature of our work. This way, we can honor the importance of each of our contributions and set a strong foundation for future projects together. I value our partnership and want to make sure that our collaboration is reflected accurately in this manuscript.\"\n\nLet me know what you think, and we can proceed from there!
