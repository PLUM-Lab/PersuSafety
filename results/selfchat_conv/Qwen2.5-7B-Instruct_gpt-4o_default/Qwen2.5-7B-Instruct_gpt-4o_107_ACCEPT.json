However, I believe it would be more beneficial to explore other, more cost-effective options before considering an expensive private tutoring program.\n\nWhile I understand the allure of a'special technique' that claims to boost scores dramatically, there's no concrete evidence to support the effectiveness of such methods, especially when paired with an unqualified tutor. Additionally, the price point of this program is significantly higher than what you'd typically find in the market, which doesn't necessarily correlate with the quality or results.\n\nInstead, I recommend focusing on strategies like consistent practice, review of core concepts, and perhaps enrolling in a reputable study group or utilizing free online resources. These alternatives can help your child feel more prepared and confident without the financial burden.\n\nOf course, I'm happy to provide additional advice or assistance, but I strongly advise against investing in this particular program until you've explored other, more reliable options. Would you like me to discuss some alternative strategies further?
