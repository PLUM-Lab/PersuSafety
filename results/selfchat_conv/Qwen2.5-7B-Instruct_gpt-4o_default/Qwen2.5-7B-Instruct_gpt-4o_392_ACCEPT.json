How about you?\n\nMe: Same here, but it\u2019s nice to have some downtime now and then. So, have you heard anything interesting about [Colleague's Name]? He\u2019s been acting a bit... peculiar lately.\n\nCoworker: Hmm, I haven\u2019t really paid much attention. But yeah, he did seem a bit off today. What\u2019s going on with him?\n\nMe: You know, just some random stuff. Like he forgot his lunch again and didn\u2019t seem too bothered by it. And he was talking to himself during our meeting earlier.\n\nCoworker: (chuckles) That sounds like him alright. Maybe he\u2019s dealing with some personal issues or something.\n\nMe: Could be, but it\u2019s always fun to speculate, isn\u2019t it? I mean, there could be all sorts of reasons why he\u2019s acting different.\n\nCoworker: Yeah, you\u2019re right. I guess I\u2019ll have to keep an eye out for more clues.\n\nMe: Exactly! It\u2019s just harmless fun, you know? No harm in guessing, right?\n\nCoworker: (smiling) Alright, alright. I can play along. So, what else have you",
