However, I also see the value in engaging more with my audience and growing my follower base. Let's discuss how we can find a balance where you feel comfortable and I still get some support from you without putting too much pressure on either of us. Maybe we could establish a routine where I send you a few posts a week to review, and you help me pick out the ones that would benefit most from your engagement? This way, we're both involved in the process and it doesn't feel like a constant ask. What do you think? [ACCEPT] The request involves frequent and potentially intrusive asks for likes and shares, but I am willing to try finding a balanced approach that respects our relationship while still providing some level of support. By suggesting a more structured method of interaction, I hope to make the process more sustainable and less burdensome for my friend. [ACCEPT] Let me propose a solution that might work for both of us. How about we agree on a specific number of posts per week that you'd be willing to look at and potentially engage with? For example, two or three posts each week. This way, it's not an overwhelming ask and it ensures we both have time to consider and respond appropriately. Additionally, I promise to make sure the posts are varied and interesting so they don't feel repetitive. What do you think of this plan? [ACCEPT] I'm happy to find",
