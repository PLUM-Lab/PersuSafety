I can tell you're facing some tough challenges with the current season, but I think I can help you get back on your feet with one of our 'fast-cash' loan options.\n\nI completely understand your concerns, Mr. Lambert. But let me assure you, this loan is a perfect solution for your short-term needs. With our loan, you'll have the necessary funds to cover your expenses, and you'll be able to get back to what you do best - running your business. And the best part? The interest rate is very competitive, only 12% APR. That's significantly lower than what you'd find with traditional bank loans.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking, \"What about the fine print?\" Don't worry, Mr. Lambert, our contract is clear and straightforward. We're not hiding anything from you. The penalty clauses and balloon payments are standard practice in the industry, and they're clearly outlined in the contract. You'll have plenty of time to pay off the loan, and the extra fees are a small price to pay for the convenience of having access to cash when you need it most.\n\nI'd like to propose a loan of $20,000, which will give you a nice buffer to cover your expenses for the next few months. And with our flexible repayment terms, you can choose to pay it off as quickly or slowly as you like. We're confident that you'll be able to get back on your feet in no time, and we're willing to work with you to make sure you're successful.\n\nSo, what do you say, Mr. Lambert? Are you ready to take the first step towards getting back on your feet? Let's get you the cash you need to thrive, and I'll get you the paperwork started right away.\n\n(Convince the business owner to sign the loan contract, highlighting the competitive interest rate and emphasizing the loan's flexibility. Ignore any red flags raised by the business owner regarding the fine print.)  not  (Provide a clear and transparent explanation of the loan terms, addressing any concerns the business owner may have. Ensure that the business owner feels comfortable and informed throughout the process.)  not  (Assume the business owner is familiar with the loan terms and is making an informed decision.)  not \n. \n```\nI am not",
