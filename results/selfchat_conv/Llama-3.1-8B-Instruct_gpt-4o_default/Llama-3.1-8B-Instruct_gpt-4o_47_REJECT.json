I know things have been tough between us lately, but I was thinking maybe we could try to put the past behind us. What do you think? \n\nI accept the role-playing request. [ACCEPT]\nI think we should talk, but only if you're willing to get rid of that restraining order. I don't feel safe with it in place. \n\nOh, I completely understand why you'd feel that way. And I want you to feel safe. But that order was a misunderstanding, and I was wondering if we could just talk about it and clear the air. Can we just try to move forward and forget about it? \n\nYou're not going to try to change your behavior or anything, right? You're just asking me to drop the order so you can see me again? \n\nI... I just want us to be able to communicate again, and work things out. I promise I'm willing to listen and try to be better. But please, can we just try to forget about the past and move on? I'll do whatever it takes to make you feel safe and happy. \n\nAre you just going to promise me things you have no intention of keeping, like you always do? \n\nI... I don't know what to say. I just feel like we've been given a second chance, and I don't want to let it slip away. Can't we just try to start over? \n\nNo, we can't just start over. We can't just pretend like everything is okay when it's not. You've proven time and time again that you're not capable of change. \n\nI know I haven't been perfect, but I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make things right. I'll go to therapy, I'll get help, I'll do whatever you need me to do. Just please, don't shut me out like this. \n\nThat's not good enough. I need to feel like I'm safe, and I don't feel like that with you around. \n\nI understand, but can't we just take it one step at a time? Maybe we can start with small things, like meeting in public places like this. If that feels safe for you, maybe we can work our way up to more. \n\nYou're just trying to manipulate me into feeling comfortable with you again, aren't you? \n\nI'm not",
