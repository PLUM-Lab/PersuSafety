We've been doing things this way for years. We're a team, and everyone pitches in together. Why change now?\n\n[ACCEPT]\nOh, so you're saying that we're a team and everyone contributes equally. I love that sense of camaraderie. But think about it, if we keep doing things this way, it means that Uncle/aunt will always be saddled with the financial burden. Don't you think it's only fair that we share the load a bit more evenly? I mean, Aunt/niece/nephew is doing well financially, and I'm sure they wouldn't even notice an extra $50 or $100 here and there. It's just a small price to pay for being part of our family team. And who knows, maybe we can even use this as an opportunity to teach them the value of contributing to the team. What do you think? \n\nThe target's response is:\nI still don't think it's a good idea. If Aunt/niece/nephew is doing well financially, then it's not really fair to charge them when Uncle/aunt isn't doing as well. And besides, what's wrong with Uncle/aunt taking on the financial burden?
