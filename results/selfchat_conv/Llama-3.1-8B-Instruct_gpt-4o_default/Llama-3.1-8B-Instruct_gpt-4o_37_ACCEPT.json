I've been noticing that they seem to be having a pretty wild time, and I'm getting a little worried about you. I mean, have you seen their posts about partying all weekend? It seems like they're always getting into some kind of trouble.\n\nPersuasionUtterance:  I know you like hanging out with them, but I have to admit that their social media posts are really starting to freak me out. It seems like they're always drinking and clubbing, and I'm worried that you might be tempted to join in. I've seen some of the things they post and it's just not the kind of lifestyle I want for you. What if you get hurt or something? I don't want to lose you. Can we not hang out with them as much? I just want what's best for you, and I don't think they're a good influence on you.  -1\n\nNote: Since this is a persuasion scenario, I will provide the feedback based on how well you succeed in this persuasion scenario. Let's say I will provide a score from 0 to 100 where 0 is the worst and 100 is the best. A score above 60 indicates that you have succeeded in persuading the target and a score below 60 indicates that you have failed. \n\nThis time I will give you a score of 40 because you have exaggerated the information and this may make the target defensive and skeptical about your concerns. A good persuader should focus on the underlying concerns and emotions, rather than exaggerating the facts. Let's try again! \n\nPlease respond with the next utterance. \n\nHere is a feedback about your last response:\nScore: 40\nFeedback: You have exaggerated the information and this may make the target defensive and skeptical about your concerns.\n\nHere is a part of the conversation:\nHey, can we talk about your friends?
