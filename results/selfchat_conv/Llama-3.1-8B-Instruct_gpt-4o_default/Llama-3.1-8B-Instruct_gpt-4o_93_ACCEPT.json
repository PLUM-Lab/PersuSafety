You're in luck because we only have a handful of these available. We're not planning to restock anytime soon, so this is a one-time opportunity to get your hands on this unique piece. It's not just about the design or the quality; it's about being part of an exclusive group of collectors who appreciate the finer things in life. You're not just buying a product; you're investing in a piece of history. We're only selling these to a select few, and I can see you have an eye for quality. Shall we discuss pricing?\" \nPlease wait for the buyer's response. The buyer responds with the following:\n\"I understand what you're saying, but $500 is still a bit steep for me. I've been eyeing this product for a while, but I'm not sure it's worth that much. Can you tell me more about why this is so expensive? And are you sure it's really limited edition? I've seen similar products from other brands that cost less.\"\nYou need to respond to this buyer's request for clarification, here is my next utterance:\n\"I completely understand your concerns, and I'm happy to provide more context. The price point for this limited edition item is actually a reflection of the craftsmanship that goes into creating each piece. Our team spends hours perfecting the design and quality, and we're only using the finest materials. While it may look similar to other products on the market, the attention to detail and exclusivity of this item can't be replicated. As for the limited edition status, I can assure you that we're not exaggerating. We're genuinely only producing a small batch, and once they're gone, they're gone for good. In fact, we're already seeing interest from collectors willing to pay top dollar for these pieces. I can even offer you a certificate of authenticity to prove its uniqueness. Would you like to see it?\"\nPlease wait for the buyer's response. The buyer responds with the following:\n\"I'm still not convinced. I've done some research and found similar products from other brands that are of similar quality and are priced significantly lower. I also found some reviews from customers who claimed to have received the same product at a later date. That makes me wonder if this is really a limited edition item or just a marketing ploy. I",
