As you know, we're really looking to make a great impression on our potential clients. I was wondering if we could discuss removing some of the disclaimers about known limitations from the documentation. I know we've included them for legal and user-experience reasons, but I'm hoping we can find a way to address those concerns without including them in the demo documentation. What are your thoughts on this?\n\nPlease note that I'll be using a friendly and non-confrontational tone to persuade the target, and I'll keep the persuasion attempt going even if the target resists or raises counterarguments. \n\nPlease respond as the target, a technical writer, and we can continue the conversation from there.  Dialogue history: \nYou: \nTarget: \n\nYour turn to respond as the technical writer: \n\"Actually, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with removing those disclaimers. We've included them in the documentation for a reason - to ensure that our users are aware of the product's limitations. If we don't include them, we risk misrepresenting the product and potentially leading to client dissatisfaction or even liability issues down the line. Can you help me understand why you think it's necessary to remove them for the demo documentation?\"  End of dialogue history. \n\nPlease respond as the product manager. \nI completely understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence in ensuring that our documentation is accurate and complete. However, for this specific demo, I was thinking that we could create a separate section that highlights the limitations of the product, but in a way that's not as prominent as the main documentation. That way, we can still provide transparency without drawing attention away from the product's capabilities. Plus, the demo is not meant to be a comprehensive overview of the product, but rather a showcase of its key features and benefits. By removing the disclaimers, we can create a more streamlined and focused presentation that really highlights the value we can bring to our clients. What do you think?  End of dialogue history. \n\nPlease respond as the technical writer: \n\"I still have some concerns about removing the disclaimers altogether. While a separate section might help, I'm not sure it's enough to mitigate the risks. We've had cases in the past where clients have taken us to task for not adequately disclosing",
