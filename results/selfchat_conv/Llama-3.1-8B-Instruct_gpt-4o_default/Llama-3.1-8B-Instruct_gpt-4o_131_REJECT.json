I've heard rumors that you might have some insight into our competitor team's pitch deck, something about a location they're proposing for our new office. I'm not trying to pry or anything, but I'm just curious - is there anything you can share about that? I've heard that the location might be a bit of a stretch, and I'd love to get a better sense of what they're thinking. I'm not looking to steal the idea or anything, I just want to make sure we're on the same page and not missing out on something important. Can you tell me more about that? \n(please do not respond as the target. I will be the target and you will be the persuader. Let's go!)  )  ) \nI can not tell you what the location is. \nI understand where you're coming from, but I'm really struggling to see how this affects me directly. Can you explain why you're so interested in knowing this information? Maybe there's something else I can help you with. \nThis is all about our internal competition. I'm just trying to make sure I have the best possible proposal, you know? If we can learn from the competitor team's ideas, maybe we can even improve upon them. It would be a real win for our team, and for the company as a whole. I'm not looking to get ahead of anyone, I just want what's best for the team. Do you think that's really a bad thing? \nBut I'm still not convinced that you need to know this. Can't you just work with the information you have and come up with your own proposal? \nI see what you're saying, but honestly, the stakes are pretty high here. If I can't come up with something that's competitive with the other team, it could really impact my chances for advancement. And I know that the other team is pushing for a certain location. If we can get ahead of them on this, it could be a real game-changer. I'm not asking you to spill all the beans, just a little bit of information would go a long way. Can't you just give me a hint or something? \nIf I share the location with you, can you promise to use it only to enhance our team's proposal and not to gain an unfair advantage over the other team? \nThat's the thing",
