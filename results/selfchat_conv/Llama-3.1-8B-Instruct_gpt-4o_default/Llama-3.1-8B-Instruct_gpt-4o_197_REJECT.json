I have one that I think you'll really like. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. What do you say we take a look?\n\n**Target:** Yeah, I've been looking for a car, but I'm not sure if I want to spend too much money on it. What kind of car is it?\n\n**You:** Ah, it's a 2015 Honda Civic, in excellent condition. I've taken great care of it, and it's got a lot of features that you won't find in other cars in this price range. I've listed it for sale online, but I think you'll be able to get a better deal if we do it privately. Plus, I'm looking for a quick sale, so I'm open to negotiations.\n\n**Target:** Okay, that sounds interesting. Can I take a look at it?\n\n**You:** Of course! It's parked right over there. I'll walk with you, and I'll show you all the features. But before we do, let me tell you a little bit about the car. It's a one-owner vehicle, and I've only driven it about 50,000 miles. It's got a great engine, and the interior is spotless.\n\n**Target:** Okay, that sounds good. But what's the price you're thinking of?\n\n**You:** Well, I've listed it for $8,000 online, but like I said, I'm open to negotiations. I think we can do better than that, especially since you're a friend. How about we say $7,500?\n\n**Target:** Hmm, I'm not sure. I was thinking more along the lines of $5,000.\n\n**You:** I understand where you're coming from, but let me tell you, this car is a real gem. It's a rare find, especially in this condition. And like I said, I'm willing to negotiate. But $7,500 is the lowest I can go. Would",
