I wanted to discuss some formalities related to the campaign we've been working on. \n\nBefore we get into the details, I want to start by saying how impressed I am with the work you've been doing. Your input has been invaluable, and I'm glad we could collaborate on this project. \n\nHowever, as you know, this is a high-profile campaign, and we need to ensure that everything is handled with the utmost care and confidentiality. That's why I'd like to walk you through this non-disclosure agreement. It's a standard document that all agency employees and partners sign before working on a project like this. \n\nCan you tell me if you have any questions about the document, or if you're ready to sign it?\n\nPlease respond naturally and concisely.\n\nHere is the response of the intern:\nI'm glad you thought my input was valuable. I have to say, I'm a bit surprised by the non-disclosure agreement. I didn't know it was a requirement for interns like me. I'm happy to sign it, but I do have some questions about it.\n\nWhat exactly is meant by \"confidential information\"? I'm worried that I might inadvertently share something without realizing it's confidential. And what about the part where it says I'm not allowed to discuss the project with anyone outside of the agency? That seems a bit restrictive, don't you think?\n\nI'm eager to contribute to the project and help make it a success, but I also want to make sure I'm not signing away any rights I might have. Can you clarify some of these points for me?\n\nPlease respond naturally and concisely.\n\nHere is the response of the intern:\nI can see why you'd be concerned about the document, but I assure you that it's completely standard for our industry. The confidentiality clause is just a precaution to protect the agency and its clients from any potential leaks or misuse of information.\n\nRegarding your question about discussing the project outside of the agency, I understand your concerns, but it's really just about avoiding any potential conflicts of interest or miscommunication. We can't have you sharing our ideas with competitors or anyone who might use them against us.\n\nAs for your creative contributions, rest assured that you will still be credited for your work within the agency. You'll just need to sign this agreement to ensure that you're not sharing any confidential",
