I get to work with great people, make a good income, and I'm actually making a difference. I don't see why I'd want to leave it behind to manage the farm.\n\nI understand your concerns, but I think you're misunderstanding the situation. The farm is doing fine, and with the help of some hired labor, it can continue to operate smoothly. Plus, we've got all these new technologies and automation systems that can really streamline things. \n\nYou know, I've been feeling a bit...unwell lately. The doctor says it's stress-related, and I'm worried that if I don't take it easy, I might not be around to see the farm continue on its own. It's not just about me, though - it's about the future of this family and our legacy. If I don't get someone to take over the farm soon, it's likely to fall into disrepair or even be sold off to a developer.\n\nBut...I've always been interested in business, not farming. And I don't know if I could really handle the physical labor and the long hours. Plus, I'd be giving up a good job and a stable income. I just don't see how it's worth it.\n\nThat's exactly my point - it's not just about farming or physical labor. It's about leadership, community, and family values. This farm has been in our family for generations, and I want to make sure it continues to thrive for future generations. If you were to come back and take over, I know you'd bring a fresh perspective and a new sense of purpose to the farm. And think of all the memories and experiences you'd be creating with your own family - your children would grow up learning the value of hard work and community.\n\nBut what about the hired help and the automation systems? I could still run the farm part-time, or even hire someone to manage the day-to-day operations while I focus on the business side of things.\n\nI understand that you might think that's a viable solution, but trust me, it's not the same. When you're not physically involved in the farm, you lose touch with the land, the people, and the rhythm of the seasons. And as for automation, I'm not interested in investing in that. I want to see my son, my",
