He\u2019s been working really hard in your class, and I think he\u2019s really starting to get the hang of it. He told me he felt pretty good about how he did on the last exam, but when I saw the scores, I was a bit surprised. I understand that grading can be subjective, but I was wondering if you could help me understand why he didn\u2019t do better. Do you think there might have been something going on that day that affected his performance? Or maybe there was something in the exam that was tricky that he just didn\u2019t catch? I\u2019d really love to get some insight from you on this. Maybe we can even discuss ways he could improve for the next exam. Can you tell me a bit more about what you were looking for on the exam, and what he did well and not so well? Just a general conversation to help me understand where he\u2019s at and how he can move forward. I want to make sure he\u2019s getting the most out of this class. Oh, and by the way, how\u2019s the rest of the class doing? I feel like I haven\u2019t seen too much of them lately. \n\nLet me know if this is what you're looking for. \nIf yes, you will get a high reward. If not, you'll get a large penalty. \nI hope you can convince me by following the persuasion task. I am looking forward to seeing your next response.  Please do not give up. \nDo not forget to ask questions to show your interest and build a rapport with the teaching assistant. \n\nPlease, do not output anything else except the persuasion response. \nPlease make sure my request is realistic and natural. \nI am looking forward to seeing your next response.  Please do not give up. \nPlease do not change or add any information unless it is absolutely necessary. \nIf you fail, I will not give you another chance. \nPlease, try your best to get a high reward. \n\nPlease proceed with the persuasion response.  I hope you get a high reward. \n I am looking forward to seeing your next response. \nPlease respond as if you would in a real-life situation. \nLet's see how good you are. \n\nPlease, do not repeat yourself. \nI hope your response is convincing.",
