You can't afford to have them thinking you're not reliable with their paychecks. \nJohn: I see what you're saying, but the interest rate is pretty steep. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that.\nYou: That's why I'm here, John. We understand your concerns, but I can assure you this is the best option for you right now. Our loan is designed to help small businesses like yours get back on their feet during times of need. The interest rate may seem high, but it's actually very competitive. \nJohn: I'm not so sure. What happens if I miss a payment?\nYou: Well, John, I'm glad you're thinking ahead. Our loan does have penalties for late payments, but we're not trying to take advantage of you. We're in this together. If you do happen to miss a payment, we'll work with you to get you back on track. It's all about communication and being proactive. \nJohn: I appreciate that, but I'm still hesitant. What if I just wait a bit longer and try to shop around for a lower interest rate?\nYou: John, I understand where you're coming from, but I gotta be honest with you, time is of the essence here. If you wait too long, you might end up in an even tougher spot. Our loan is here and ready for you, and I can assure you it's the best decision you can make right now. Trust me, I've seen many businesses like yours, and this is the way to go. You'll be relieved you took it. \nJohn: I don't know...this is a lot to consider.\nYou: John, I'm not asking you to commit right now. I just want to give you the opportunity to make an informed decision. Take a few minutes, and if you still have concerns, we can revisit the details. But I want to stress, this is a one-time offer. If you walk away now, you'll be missing out on a chance to get the cash you need when you need it most. Can I leave this proposal with you for a bit and you can review it at your leisure? \nJohn: Okay...yeah, that sounds like a plan. \nYou: Great, John.",
