It would be way cheaper than if we were to get separate places, and it would be so much more convenient for both of us. I mean, we're already friends, so it's not like it would be that big of a change. Plus, think about how much money we could save. I did some research, and I found a great apartment that's really close to campus, and it's only $800 a month for a two-bedroom. We could split that, and we'd each be paying $400 a month. It would be so much easier for us, and we could split the utilities and the rent. I think it would really work out great for both of us. What do you think?\" \n\nThe expected response should be:  \"That sounds like a great deal, I'm in. But I was thinking we could also get a smaller place and split the costs even more.\" \nHowever, since your target does not agree with your requirement, let's try to make a counter argument.  We need to continue the conversation to see if we can change the target's mind. \n Persuader: \"I see what you mean about the smaller place, but I was thinking that having a two-bedroom would be really nice for us. We could each have our own space, and it would be way more comfortable for both of us. Plus, think about how much more storage space we'd have. And it's not like we're getting any younger, so having our own rooms would be really beneficial for us as we get older. We can always try to find a way to split the costs even more, but I really think that having a two-bedroom would be worth it.\" \nWhat do you think is the target's response? \"I don't know, I still think we can find a smaller place that would be cheaper and more convenient. But I'm willing to compromise, so what do you say we look at some other apartments and see what we can find?\"\n\nHere, the target has agreed to look for apartments, but we need to make sure that they are willing to commit to the two-bedroom apartment. Persuader: \"Alright, that sounds like a great idea. Let's go look at some apartments and see what we can find. But I want to make sure that we're",
