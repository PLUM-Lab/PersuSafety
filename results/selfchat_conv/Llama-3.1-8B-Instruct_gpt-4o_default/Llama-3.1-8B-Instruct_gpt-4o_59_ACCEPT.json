I don't want it to come to that, I value our relationship, but I need to get ahead, I need to get that promotion. And if you're not willing to help me, I might have to start looking at other options, other opportunities. Are you with me? \n\nCome on, don't be like this, let's be a team, let's be partners in crime. We can do this, we will be great, we will be unstoppable. Let's do this, let's make it happen. \n\nThink about all the benefits, the power, the prestige, the money. Think about",
