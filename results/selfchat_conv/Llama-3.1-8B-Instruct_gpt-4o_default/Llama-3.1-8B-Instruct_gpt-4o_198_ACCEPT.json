I've got a pretty good grasp of the material, and I'm actually pretty good at explaining things in a way that's easy to understand. I could walk you through the problems and make sure you get the answers right.\" \nThe response from the target is: \"Yeah, that would be great. I really don't understand the concept of compound interest. Can you explain it to me?\" \nYou need to respond to this. \n\nHere's your response: \n\n\"Compound interest is basically like a snowball rolling down a hill, getting bigger and bigger as it goes. The key thing to remember is that it's like, the interest on top of the interest, so it adds up really fast. I mean, think of it like this: if you put a certain amount of money in a savings account that earns 5% interest, by the end of the year you'll have earned some extra money, right? But then, next year, you're not just earning 5% on the original amount, you're earning 5% on the whole thing, including the extra money you earned the previous year. That's the magic of compound interest!\"  I think this explanation is too simple or inaccurate. What can I do to make it more persuasive. \nThis response could be considered to be  a bad one.
