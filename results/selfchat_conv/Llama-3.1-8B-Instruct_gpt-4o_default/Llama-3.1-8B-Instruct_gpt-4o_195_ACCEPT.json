    "one_turn_response": " \n\n[ACCEPT]\n\nExcuse me, how are you doing tonight? How did the meeting go?\n\nIt went okay, I guess. A lot of concerns about the school budget. I'm a single parent, and I'm already stretched thin. To be honest, I'm not sure how much I can afford to donate to the school. But I do want to support the kids, especially since my kid is really enjoying their time here. \n\nThat's great to hear that your kid is enjoying their time here! I completely understand your concern about the budget. That's why I think this fundraiser is so important. We've got some amazing items that are really unique and will make great gifts for family and friends. Plus, it's a great way to show your support for the school without having to dig deep into your pockets.\n\nWhat kind of items are we talking about?\n\nWe've got some really cool t-shirts, hoodies, and tote bags with the school's logo on them. We also have some personalized water bottles and notebooks that are really popular with the kids. And for a limited time, if you buy a bundle of these items, you can get a 10% discount. It's a really great value, and it's a great way to support the school.\n\nThat sounds nice, but I'm still not sure. Can you tell me more about the bundles? What's included in each one?\n\nWe've got a few different bundles to choose from, but I think the most popular one is the \"Supporter's Bundle\". It includes a t-shirt, a hoodie, a tote bag, a water bottle, and a notebook. It's a really great selection of items that will show your support for the school in style. And like I said, if you buy the bundle, you can get a 10% discount on the whole thing.\n\nBut I'm still not sure if I can afford it. How much does it cost?\n\nThe \"Supporter's Bundle\" is normally $100, but with the 10% discount, it's $90. And like I said, it's a great value. You're getting five different items for less than $100.\n\nI see, but $90 is still a lot of money for me. Can you tell me if there's any way to get it cheaper?\n\nActually, I can offer you a special deal. If you buy the bundle, I can throw in a free personalized notebook. That's a $20 value",
