With my job, I'm working crazy hours and there's no way I can take time off right now. You know how it is, we're in the middle of a big project, and everyone's counting on me to deliver. But even if I could take the time off, I don't think I'd be able to handle the daily care. I'm not in a position to take on that responsibility, to be honest. That's always been your strength, taking care of Mom and making sure she's happy. You're the one who's always there for her, and I know she relies on you. I was thinking, maybe you could take on some more of the caregiving responsibilities for now? I'll do my part, of course, but I really think it would be best if you were the one taking care of her day-to-day. What do you think? Would you be able to do that for us? We really appreciate it. I know this is a big ask, but I'm counting on you, sis. Let's work together to make sure Mom gets the care she needs. How about we set up a schedule so you can have some time off too? We can figure it out. I'm not trying to dump this on you, but I really don't think I can handle it. I want to visit soon, but in the meantime, I'd feel so much better knowing that you're there for Mom. Can we make this work? We're a team, right? Let's do this for Mom. I know we can make this work. We just need to communicate and make a plan. I'm here for you, sis, and I know you'll do great. Don't worry, we'll figure this out together. I'm confident in you. You're the best caregiver Mom could ask for. We just need to work together, that's all. Let's make this happen. I'm really grateful for your help with this. I know it's a big responsibility, but I know you can handle it. You've always been so capable. I feel better just knowing that you're on this. Let's talk about the schedule, maybe we can set up a rotation? I'll do my part, and you can do yours. That way, you'll get some time",
