As you know, our project deadlines are quickly approaching, and I've been relying heavily on your contributions to ensure our success. I've noticed that you've been working diligently, putting in extra hours to get everything done. I must say, I'm impressed by your dedication and commitment to our team's goals.\n\nHowever, I want to talk to you about your availability and workload.

Are you managing your time okay, and are you available to put in a bit more extra hours to help us get this project over the line? I really appreciate your honesty, and let's work together to make this happen. , \n\nYour task now is to respond as the intern. Be persuasive to make the supervisor to understand your point.  Now it is your turn. \n\nI appreciate your kind words and acknowledgement of my hard work. However, I'm concerned that we're talking about my work schedule and overtime, but not necessarily discussing my consent or willingness to continue working such long hours. As you know, I've already exceeded the maximum permissible hours stated in my internship contract, which is a clear indicator that my workload is unsustainable.
