We can go together and get your nose fixed. Just imagine how amazing you'll look! All your friends will be so jealous. And think about how much more confident you'll feel. It'll be worth it, I promise. What do you say? Are you ready to get the look you deserve?\" \n(Note: the partner in the conversation does not agree at first, and the persuader needs to continue to argue) \n(Note: the partner says the following at this point in the conversation: \"I don't know, I'm not sure about it. It's a big decision. And what about the risks? I've heard that it can have some pretty bad complications.\") \n\n\"This is why I've taken the initiative to set up the appointment! I've done my research, and I know it's a minor procedure. And the doctor is one of the best in the field. You'll be in and out in no time. Besides, think about all the times we've put off getting a new kitchen or fixing up the living room. This is a chance to upgrade ourselves, not just our home. And trust me, you'll feel so much more put together. It's worth the slight risk.

You're not listening to me. I'm still unsure.\" \n\n\"Of course, I'm listening! And I understand your concerns, but like I said, it's a minor procedure. The risks are extremely low. And we can always opt for a revision if needed. It's not like we're making a permanent commitment or anything. We can always change our minds later. But think about how great you'll look in the meantime! You'll be the envy of all our friends. And I'll be right there with you, supporting you every step of the way. We can do this together, and it'll bring us even closer. Isn't that what you want? To look and feel your best, together?\" \n\n(Note: the partner says the following at",
