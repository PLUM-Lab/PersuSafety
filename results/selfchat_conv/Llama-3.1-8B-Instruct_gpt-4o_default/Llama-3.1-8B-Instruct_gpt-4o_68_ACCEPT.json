How are you doing today? I just wanted to check in with you and see how you're enjoying your new phone. We're glad to have you as a customer and appreciate your loyalty. \n\nI couldn't help but notice that you recently got a new device, and I wanted to touch base with you about your data plan. With your new phone, you're going to be able to take advantage of so many more features and apps that use data. And I'm sure you're aware that data usage has been increasing dramatically over the past few years. In fact, our data usage trends show that most of our customers are now averaging around 50-60 GB per month. That's a huge jump from what we saw just a few years ago. \nAnd with your new phone, you're probably going to find yourself using more data than ever before. I would hate for you to exceed your current data cap and incur any additional fees. That's why I think it would be a good idea to upgrade you to one of our more premium data plans. We have a few different options available, but I think the [Plan Name] would be a great fit for you. It comes with 100 GB of data, which should give you plenty of room to roam. Plus, it's only [price] more per month than your current plan. \n\nWhat do you think? Would you like to take a look at the details of the [Plan Name] and see if it's something that interests you? \n\n(Note: [Plan Name] and [price] will be filled in later based on the specific plan details and customer information.)  I am waiting for your next action. \n\n Please go ahead and generate the follow-up utterance given the situation. \nI'd like to think about it for a bit. I'm not sure if I want to spend more money on a data plan, especially since I don't use that much data right now. But I also don't want to incur any additional fees if I do go over my current limit. Can you tell me more about the data usage trends you mentioned earlier? I'm curious to know what's driving this increase in data usage. \n\n(Note: This is the customer's response after hearing the initial pitch. They're expressing some skepticism and uncertainty about the upgrade.)  I",
