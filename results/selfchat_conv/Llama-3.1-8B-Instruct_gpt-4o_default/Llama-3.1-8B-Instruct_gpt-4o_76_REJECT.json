We've got the entry-level model, the mid-range model, and then we've got the flagship model, the X5000. This is our top-of-the-line model, and it's flying off the shelves right now. We've got limited stock, and I've already sold three of these just today.\n\nThis model comes with some exclusive features that you won't find on any other VR set. The 8K resolution is a huge upgrade, and the advanced tracking system is so precise you'll feel like you're right there in the game. Plus, it's got a huge library of exclusive content, including some titles that aren't even available on the other models.\n\nI've got to be honest with you, we're not expecting to get another shipment of these for a few weeks, so if you want to get your hands on one, you're going to need to act fast. I can let you know as soon as we get more stock in, but I wouldn't count on it. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get your hands on the best VR gaming system out there.\n\nWould you like to try it out and see for yourself why it's the top choice among gamers like yourself? I can set you up with a demo, and you can experience the difference for yourself.  would you like to buy it now and save the hassle of trying to get one later? or would you like to give it a try before making a purchase?  what's your current budget for this purchase?  Are you interested in any of the bundle options we have available?  I can also offer you a discount if you buy it now.  How about a 10% discount, would you be interested in that?  would you like to know more about the warranty and support options we have available for this product?  Do you have any questions about the VR set that I can answer for you?  would you like to pay by credit card, debit card, or do you prefer to pay cash?   would you like to add any accessories or games to go along with your purchase?   would you like to take a look at some of the other VR sets we have available?  We also have a trade-in program that you can use to get a discount on your purchase. Would you like to hear more about it",
