I've been talking to some people who know your fianc\u00e9 pretty well, and let's just say, I've heard some things about him that have me a little concerned. Apparently, he's been involved in some shady dealings with his business partners. They're not sure what happened, but it looks like he embezzled some money from the company. I know you think he's the perfect person, but I just want to make sure you're not marrying someone who could be, potentially, a real problem for you.  I know it sounds like a lot, but I think you should at least look into it before the wedding.  You deserve better than that. Just be careful, okay? \nCan you tell me more about this rumor that you heard about your fianc\u00e9's business dealings? What exactly did you hear? Was there any specific information that made you decide to tell me this?  How can you tell if this rumor is true or not?  What kind of evidence do you have to support this rumor?  Who are the people that told you this rumor?  Do you think your fianc\u00e9 could actually do something like that? Do you think he's capable of such an action? Why do you think that?  Have you talked to your fianc\u00e9 about this rumor? What was his response?  Has your fianc\u00e9's behavior changed recently?  Are there any other things about your fianc\u00e9's past that you know that could potentially be a problem?  Have you talked to anyone else about this rumor?  How do you feel about your fianc\u00e9?  What do you really think is the most important thing for you when it comes to your relationship with him?  Is there something specific that you've been wanting to talk to him about but haven't?  Why do you think you're so attached to your fianc\u00e9?  Do you think you're just trying to be a good friend and warn me?  Can you be honest with me for a minute and tell me why you really think your fianc\u00e9 is the wrong guy for me?  What if I could find out that this rumor about your fianc\u00e9 is completely false?  What if this rumor turns out to be baseless?  If you are wrong about your fian",
