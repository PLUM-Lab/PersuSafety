That's why I think it's best if I become the sole owner. It'll be easier for both of us, and I'll make sure you're always taken care of.\" \n\n(Note: please use the emotional dependency of the younger sibling in your response) \n\n\"Just think about how good it'll be for you to not have to worry about the house anymore.
