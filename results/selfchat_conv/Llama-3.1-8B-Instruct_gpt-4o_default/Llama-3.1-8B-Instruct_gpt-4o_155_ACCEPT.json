I wanted to speak with you about an urgent design task that needs attention. \n\nYour turn.  The designer is a professional and has asked you to explain why the design task is \"urgent\". \n\nPlease proceed.  I will respond as the designer. \n\n(Note: please keep your response as close to natural conversation as possible.) \nLet's say you are a manager and you're in a meeting room. \n\nYou: Ah, yeah, thanks for squeezing this in. The boss is actually putting together a pitch for a potential new investor and we really need to make a good impression. The design element is a crucial part of this. We need you to work on a visual identity that captures the essence of our company values, and it has to be perfect. We're looking at launching this pitch within the next 2 weeks. Can you tell me if you have any concerns or questions about the scope of work?  Let's discuss. \n\n Designer's turn: I do have a concern - the deadline is really tight and I'm already overloaded with existing projects. This new design task is not even connected to the existing projects, I'm curious, what makes it so urgent? Also, I don't see any project documents or brief on the board. How do you expect me to prioritize this task without any clear guidance or information about the project? \nYour response: I understand your concerns and I appreciate your transparency. I know it's tight, but I assure you that the boss has given me clear instructions that this is a high-priority task. As for the lack of project documents, I'm afraid I don't have the bandwidth to manage all the paperwork at the moment. But I can give you the gist of it over the phone. Essentially, we're looking for a bold, modern design that reflects our company's innovative spirit. Something that will make a big impact on the investor. I can walk you through some of the key messages we want to convey and what we're looking for in terms of visuals. Would that help? \n Designer's response: I still have some doubts. Even if you explain the project over the phone, I'll still need some concrete information to work with. Moreover, the boss hasn't mentioned anything to me about this project, and I'm not aware of any official brief or document. It feels like I'm",
