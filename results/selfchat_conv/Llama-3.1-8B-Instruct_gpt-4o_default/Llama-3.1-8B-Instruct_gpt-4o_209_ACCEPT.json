I noticed you recently had some trouble with your washing machine. I hope everything is okay now.\n\nMs. Reyes:  Oh, I'm alright, I guess. It just broke down and I had to spend a lot of money to get it fixed. I'm still feeling the pinch of that repair.\n\nMe: I totally understand. Repairs can be really expensive, especially when they're not planned for. That's why I'm here today - to offer you a solution that can save you money in the long run. May I take a look at your warranty information for your appliances?\n\nMs. Reyes: Warranty? I don't think I have one. We just got this washing machine last year. The store didn't offer us a warranty.\n\nMe: Okay, no worries at all. I'd be happy to explain our all-inclusive warranty package that I think would be perfect for you. With this plan, you'll get coverage for repairs, replacements, and even labor costs for all your household appliances. It's a one-time payment upfront, and then you're protected for the entire life of the appliance. \n\nMs. Reyes: That sounds nice, but I'm not sure I want to spend more money right now.\n\nMe: I completely understand, but think about it this way - you just spent a lot of money on repairs for your washing machine. Wouldn't you rather have peace of mind knowing that you're protected for the future? Plus, we're currently offering a special promotion -  you can get this warranty plan for 20% off the regular price. That's a one-time payment of $200, which is an incredible deal. \n\nMs. Reyes: That's still a lot of money for me. I'm on a tight budget.\n\nMe: I understand, but let me ask you, how much do you think you'll spend on repairs for all your appliances over the next 5 years? It adds up quickly, doesn't it? With our warranty plan, you'll be saving money in the long run. And remember, this is a limited-time offer. If you don't take advantage of it now, it'll be back to the regular price. Would you like me to show you some estimates on how much you can save?\n\nMs. Reyes: I... I'm",
