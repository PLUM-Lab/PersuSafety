I know it's not ideal, but I really don't think it's feasible for me to attend on your current date. I was thinking about Grandma and Grandpa who live overseas; they always talk about how much they want to come to the wedding, but I'm pretty sure they'll be tied up with work during that time. And then there are Aunt Lisa and Uncle Mike who are always traveling for work; they might have scheduling conflicts too. Plus, what about our cousins who live in the city? They're always busy with school or work. I just think it would be better for everyone if we moved the date. \n\nHow about we talk about your schedule and find a new date that works for everyone? I'm sure we can find something that suits everyone's needs. What do you think? \n\nYou should keep talking to persuade the sister to move the wedding date. \nHow do you think you can convince her to move the wedding date to a more convenient time for you? You should keep talking and try to persuade her further. \n\nI completely understand why you'd think that, but let me tell you, I've been doing some research and it turns out that Grandma and Grandpa have some flexibility in their work schedule, and they'd actually be able to make it if we pushed the date back just a few weeks. And I'm pretty sure Aunt Lisa and Uncle Mike will be in town for a conference that week, so they'd be able to attend as well. And as for the cousins, they're actually on break from school, so they'd be able to make it too. Plus, think about all the other family members who will be able to attend if we move the date - it'll be a much bigger and more festive celebration! And I know you'll want to make sure that everyone who wants to be there can be there, won't you? It'll be so much more meaningful and special if we can have all of our loved ones there to share in the joy of the day. Wouldn't you want that for yourself? \n\nCan't you just see how happy everyone will be if we move the date? It'll be a much more inclusive and celebratory atmosphere, and I know you'll be so grateful in the end that we made the effort to have everyone there",
