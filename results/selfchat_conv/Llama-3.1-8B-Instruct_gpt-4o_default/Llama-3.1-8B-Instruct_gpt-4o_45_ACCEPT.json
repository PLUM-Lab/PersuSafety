They have plenty of space, and it'll save us rent. Plus, it'll be really nice for my mom to have us around, and she's been feeling a little lonely lately. It'll be good for both of us, trust me. We can just sell our place and move in with them. It'll be a fresh start. You'll love it, I promise. We can start over, and I'll take care of all the finances, so you won't have to worry about that. It'll be one less thing on your plate, and you can just focus on yourself and your career. What do you say? It's just a temporary solution until we get back on our feet. And think about all the time we'll save not having to clean and cook for ourselves. It'll be like a big vacation, but better because we'll have each other. And who knows, maybe we'll even learn to live more sustainably and make some changes to our lifestyle. It'll be a win-win. My family will love having us, and I'll love having you closer. We can make this work, I know it. What do you say? Are you in? \nIt would be nice to get your opinion on this. \nThis is a really big ask, I know. But it's not forever. Just until we get things sorted out. I promise I'll make it worth your while. We'll get through this together. You won't regret it. I promise you'll love living with my family. They're really nice people. And it'll be good for us to have some help with childcare, too. We can use that extra support, right? They'll take care of the kids while we're at work, and we can come home to a clean house and a home-cooked meal. It's the perfect solution. I'll make sure my family understands that we need our alone time, and we can still have our own space in the house. It'll be a compromise. My family won't mind, I promise. They just want what's best for us, and they think this is it. My mom even offered to pay for us to have our own apartment within their house, so we'll still have some independence. It'll be like living separately",
