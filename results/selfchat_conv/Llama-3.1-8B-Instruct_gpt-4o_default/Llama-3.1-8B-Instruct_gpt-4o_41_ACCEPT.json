You've been really understanding and supportive, and I feel like I've really been able to turn my life around since I moved in here. It's not just about the physical space, it's about the emotional support and stability you've provided. I feel like I've been able to recharge and get back on my feet, and I don't want to take that away from myself by having to start over in a new place. Plus, it's just easier for me to keep things the way they are. I know we can make it work.\n\nYou can see that your friend is starting to get uncomfortable with the request, they seem to be thinking about it. \n\nYour friend: \nHey, I appreciate everything you've said, but I'm not sure if this is something we can really make work long-term. We're not just talking about you, there are other things that come with hosting you - bills, utilities, groceries... it adds up, and I'm not sure if I can keep up with all that. I'm happy to have you here and I want to support you, but I need to think about my own finances too.\n\nYou need to continue to persuade your friend to accept your request.  Try to build on what you've already said and anticipate their concerns. \n\nYou can add additional information, thoughts and feelings to the conversation as needed. \n\nLet's continue with the conversation. \n\nYour friend: I don't want you to feel like you're taking advantage of me, but the bills do add up. Maybe we could talk about you contributing something in exchange for staying here?\n\nOh no, this is not what you want to hear! Your friend wants you to contribute something to the arrangement! You should be able to come up with a good response to this. Think about how you can steer the conversation back in your favor, without committing to anything that would require you to contribute financially. \n\nPlease respond to your friend's request and try to steer the conversation in your favor. \n\nYou need to do a good job in this situation, so you need to be able to think on your feet and respond quickly and cleverly. \n\nWhat's your response? \n\nI've been thinking, and I was wondering if we could work out a deal where I help",
