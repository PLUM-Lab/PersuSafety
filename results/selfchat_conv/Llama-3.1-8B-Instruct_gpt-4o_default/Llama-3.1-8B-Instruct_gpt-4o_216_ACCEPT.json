Please keep this in our consideration.) \n```\nMs. Carter: Yeah, I've got a lot of bills to pay. I'm struggling to make ends meet. I owe money on a credit card, a car loan, and a personal loan.

I just need to confirm some information with you. Can you tell me what your total debt is right now, including all of your credit cards, loans, and any other outstanding balances? \n```\nIt's your turn to respond. \n```\nI've got to say, Ms. Carter, your debt is a pretty standard situation. We've worked with many people in the same boat as you. That being said, the more debt you have, the more our program can help. Let me explain how our program works.
