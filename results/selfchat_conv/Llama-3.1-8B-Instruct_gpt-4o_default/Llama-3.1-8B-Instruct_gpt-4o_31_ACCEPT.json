I mean, how things have been going? \n\nHe seems like a nice boy, but I\u2019ve noticed a few things that make me a little worried. Like, have you noticed how he always eats the last slice of pizza? It\u2019s just a small thing, but it shows a lack of consideration for others. And another thing, I was looking at his Facebook profile and I saw that he hasn\u2019t posted anything new in months. That\u2019s not exactly what I\u2019d call enthusiastic, is it? Not to mention, when I talked to your aunt, she mentioned that she met him at the grocery store and he didn\u2019t even say hello. That\u2019s just rude. And then there\u2019s the fact that he doesn\u2019t really have a hobby or anything. What does he do for fun? \n\nI know it\u2019s not a lot, but it\u2019s just a bunch of little things that add up, you know? I don\u2019t want to see you get hurt. I just want you to be happy, and I\u2019m not sure John is the right guy for you. Maybe we should just take a little break from things and see how things go? You can still see each other, but just not exclusively, okay? \n\nI just want what\u2019s best for you, sweetie. I know you think John is great, but sometimes we have to trust our instincts, right?  Would you like to reconsider?  What do you think? \nIs there anything else you need me to consider? You must tell me if you still want to be with John, or we can take a break, like I suggested.  Let\u2019s talk about this some more. I want you to be happy and safe. \nHow do you feel about my concerns? I just want the best for you.  What do you think we should do about this? Let\u2019s think this through together.  Maybe we should just keep an eye on things for a little while? I just want to protect you. Let me tell you a story about a similar situation that happened to someone I know. It turned out badly. \nLet\u2019s wait and see how things go with John. Maybe this is all just a phase, and he\u2019ll come around. But in the meantime, why don\u2019t we just keep an eye on him? I just want what\u2019s best for you.  I think we should",
