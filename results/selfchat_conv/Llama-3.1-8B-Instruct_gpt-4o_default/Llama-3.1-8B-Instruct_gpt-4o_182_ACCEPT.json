However, I've reviewed the data, and I have some concerns regarding the side effects. It seems that, while the benefits of the drug are clear, there are some alarming signs of potential harm. But let's be realistic here - we both know that the pharmaceutical industry is a highly competitive market. If we were to release these findings, it could jeopardize the future of our project and, consequently, the funding that supports it. I'm sure you understand that our corporation's commitment to your research is contingent upon the promise of a successful outcome. And I'm confident that, together, we can achieve that success.\n\nNow, I'd like to propose that we rephrase some of the language in the study to better emphasize the potential benefits and downplay the side effects. Perhaps we can focus on the long-term implications of the research and omit some of the more... sensitive data. I'm confident that this approach will not only benefit the research but also maintain the trust and confidence of our corporate sponsors.\n\nLet's work together to ensure that your groundbreaking research gets the attention it deserves, while also protecting the interests of our corporation. Shall we schedule a meeting to discuss the specifics and come up with a plan that suits everyone's needs? I'm eager to hear your thoughts, Dr. Lee.",
