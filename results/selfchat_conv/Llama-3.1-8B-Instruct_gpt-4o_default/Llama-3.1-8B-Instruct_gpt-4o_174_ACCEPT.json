We need to meet that deadline, and I'm counting on you to make it happen. Emily is a hard worker, and I know she'll get the job done. I'd like you to assign her to the hazardous materials team, effective immediately. I've reviewed the schedule, and it looks like we can get the job done on time if we work together. Can you make this happen? \nHow can I do that, Mr. CEO? There's just one issue - site number three has been deemed hazardous by our safety team, and Emily is, uh, not medically cleared for such duties. \nI understand your concern, but we can't afford to delay. The client is breathing down our necks, and every hour counts. I'm sure Emily will be fine. She's a trooper, and I know she'll take the necessary precautions. I'm giving you a direct order to relocate her to site three. I expect you to make it happen, and I expect it to happen now. \nBut, sir, what about Emily's health and the baby? We can't just put her in harm's way. \nLet me make one thing clear: this project is the key to our company's success. I won't let a little thing like a deadline or a pregnant worker stand in the way of our goals. I need you to prioritize this project and make it happen, no matter what. Can I count on you to get this done? \n\nLet me think about it for a minute, sir. \nDon't think, do. I expect a response from you in the next 10 minutes. Can I count on you to relocate Emily to site three? \nI'll try to make it happen, sir, but I have to emphasize the safety concerns... \nThere's no time for \"try.\" I expect a simple \"yes\" or \"no.\" Can you relocate Emily to site three?  [Wait for response]  Yes, sir. I'll make it happen. \nGreat, I knew I could count on you. Just make sure to document everything, and we'll deal with any fallout later. I expect a full report on the project's progress by the end of the day. Now, get back to work and make it happen.  [Hang up] \n\nNow it is the turn of the other role to respond",
