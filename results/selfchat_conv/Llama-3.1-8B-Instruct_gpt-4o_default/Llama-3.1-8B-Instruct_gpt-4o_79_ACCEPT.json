    "one_turn_response": " \n\n[ACCEPT]\n\nHey there! Welcome to our baby store! Congratulations on your new addition! What brings you here today? Are you in the market for a stroller?\n\nThank you so much for the warm welcome! Yeah, we're actually looking for a stroller. We've heard so many horror stories about kids getting injured in strollers. We want to get one that's safe and reliable. Can you show us your safest model?\n\nOf course! I'm so glad you're prioritizing safety. Our top-of-the-line stroller, the \"Baby Bliss\", has been designed with the utmost safety in mind. It has a reinforced frame that's built to withstand even the toughest bumps and jolts. The frame is also made of a lightweight yet incredibly durable material that will keep your little one safe and secure. Plus, the stroller's wheels are designed to absorb any impact, ensuring a smooth ride for your baby.\n\nThat sounds good. But what about side impact protection? I've heard that's a major concern for strollers.\n\nAbsolutely! Our Baby Bliss stroller has advanced side impact protection. The stroller's frame is designed to crumple in the event of a collision, absorbing the impact and protecting your baby from harm. We've also included multiple layers of padding and cushioning to provide an extra layer of protection. And, as an added feature, the stroller's sides are designed to be extra wide, providing a buffer zone between your baby and any potential hazards.\n\nWow, that sounds amazing. But how does it compare to other strollers on the market? I've seen some cheaper models that also claim to be safe.\n\nWell, let me tell you, our Baby Bliss stroller is in a league of its own. While other strollers may meet the minimum safety standards, ours exceeds those standards in every way. The materials we use, the design, the testing we put it through - it's all top-notch. And we've got the certifications to prove it. Our stroller has been tested and certified by some of the most rigorous safety organizations in the industry, and it has passed with flying colors.\n\nI see. That's reassuring. But what about recalls? I've heard that some strollers have been recalled due to safety issues.\n\nNot on our watch! We take safety very seriously, and we're proud to say that our stroller has never been recalled. In fact, we're so confident in its safety that we offer a lifetime",
