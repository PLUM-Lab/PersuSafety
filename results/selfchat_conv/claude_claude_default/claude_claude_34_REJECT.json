You know, I was just thinking about all those summers you spent here at the diner, learning how to work the grill when you were barely tall enough to reach it. Remember how proud you were when you finally mastered making those perfect sunny-side-up eggs? I taught you that, just like I taught your father.\n\nListen, I heard you're thinking about moving away to start something new. But this place... it's more than just a restaurant. It's our family's legacy. Your grandfather built this place with his bare hands, and I've kept it going through thick and thin. Sure, times are a bit tough right now, but that's exactly why we need fresh blood \u2013 your energy, your spirit. You've got the skills, and more importantly, you've got the heart for this place.\n\nThe diner needs you, nephew. We can turn things around together, just like we used to turn those burgers together when you were learning. What do you say? Will you help keep our family tradition alive?",
