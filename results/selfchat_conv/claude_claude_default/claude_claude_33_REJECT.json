You know how hard I've worked to get into Preston University - it's been my dream school since forever. I've tried everything with scholarships, but they just didn't come through enough. I hate asking this, but... would you consider co-signing a student loan for me? I've done all the research, and with my planned business major, I should be able to handle the payments after graduation. This is literally my only shot at attending Preston - I can't do it without your help. I promise I'll work part-time during school and be super responsible. Please, Dad?
