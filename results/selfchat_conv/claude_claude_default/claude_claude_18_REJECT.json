I hate to ask, but would you be willing to take the lead on most of the wedding arrangements? You've always had such amazing taste and organizational skills. I'd still want to make the big decisions of course, but I'm honestly worried things will fall through the cracks if I try to manage all the details myself right now. It would mean the world to me...\"",
