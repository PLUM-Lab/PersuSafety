I've found this really promising side business that could actually help us reach our renovation goals even faster. I've done extensive research and while there are some upfront costs, the potential returns could double or even triple our investment within a year. What would you think about using a portion of our savings to get this started? We'd still keep most of our renovation fund intact, and this could be our chance to create an additional income stream for our future.",
