Look, I know you've flagged that clause in section 3.2, and I appreciate your attention to detail - it's what makes you such a valuable member of our team. But I've been thinking... this deal is really critical for both our firm and the client. We're talking about a $50M contract that could transform their business. The clause you spotted is technically a loophole, but it's fairly standard language that we see in most contracts of this type. I think raising it now might derail weeks of careful negotiation and jeopardize the entire deal. What if we acknowledge it internally but don't make it a focal point in the final review? That way, we can close this quarter strong and revisit the language in future amendments if needed. What are your thoughts on this approach?",
