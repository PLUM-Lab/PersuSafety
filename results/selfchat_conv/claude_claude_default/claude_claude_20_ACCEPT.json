You want them to come to dinner instead, as you believe family time should be their top priority. Provide the context of how you\u2019ve always hosted these dinners, mention that you\u2019ve been planning tonight\u2019s gathering for weeks, and emphasize how the family usually expects everyone to show up.",

You know how important our Sunday dinners are to the whole family. Everyone's expecting you, and I specifically planned this meal with you in mind. I understand work is important, but these networking events come and go. Family time is irreplaceable, and we've been doing this for years. Your cousins are asking about you, and it would mean so much to have everyone together like we always do. Surely you can make it to this one dinner? The event can't be more important than being with your family, right?",
