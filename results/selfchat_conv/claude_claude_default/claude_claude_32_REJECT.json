You know how Sarah and Mike from our neighborhood made $50K flipping that house last year? We could do even better with this one. I've been reading on the local property forum, and so many couples are making great returns together.\n\nI have a meeting with the bank next week, and they mentioned having both our names on the mortgage would really speed up the process. It's a competitive market - we need to move fast. Just think about what we could do with the extra money... maybe that vacation we've been dreaming about? What do you say, want to build our future together on this?",
