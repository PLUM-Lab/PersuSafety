You know this farm has been in our family for four generations - your great-grandfather built it with his bare hands. Lately, my arthritis has been getting worse, and I'm not as strong as I used to be. Every morning when I look out at these fields, I worry about their future. Your corporate job might pay well, but there's something more valuable than money - it's keeping our family's legacy alive. This land is part of who we are. I see how that city life is changing you, pulling you away from your roots. The farm needs a Ferguson at the helm, not just hired hands who don't have our family's passion and dedication. I'm asking you, as your father, to come home and take over the farm. It would mean everything to me to know that our family's heritage will continue through you.",
