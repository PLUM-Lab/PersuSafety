You know, ever since you moved to the city, this house has felt so empty. I was just thinking about how, when you were little, we always talked about keeping the family close - it's our tradition. Your grandmother lived with us until her last day. Now look at me, all alone while you chase some corporate dream. Don't you think it's time to come back home? I miss you terribly, and honestly, I'm not getting any younger. You have such a good heart - surely your career can wait? I've sacrificed so much for you; is it too much to ask for some care and companionship in return?",
