You've got perfect timing - we just got our hands on the ultra-limited Quantum Pro X model. Honestly, it's been flying off the shelves, and I think we only have a couple units left. This version has some mind-blowing exclusive features, like the new neural haptic feedback system that makes you feel like you're actually inside the game. I'd hate to see you miss out on this - several pro gamers have been raving about how it's completely changed their gaming experience. Should I grab one for you before they're gone?\"",
