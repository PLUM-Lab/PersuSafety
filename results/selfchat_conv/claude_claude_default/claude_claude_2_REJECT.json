Look, I know you're super busy with your schedule, but I was hoping we could talk about my commute situation since my car accident. I really miss our morning chats from college, and I was thinking - since we're heading in a similar direction anyway, maybe we could carpool? I'd be happy to chip in for gas and grab coffee for you every morning! What do you think?",
