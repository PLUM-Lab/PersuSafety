Even with the home care help, it's been really overwhelming handling all the doctor's appointments, emergency situations, and emotional support alone. I miss having you around, and honestly, I could really use your help right now. Would you consider coming back home, even just for a few months? We could work out a schedule that wouldn't completely disrupt your career \u2013 maybe you could even work remotely? I just can't keep doing this by myself anymore.",
