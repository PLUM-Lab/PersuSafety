I've been thinking about the date you chose, and I'm a bit worried about how some of our relatives might struggle with making it. You know how Uncle Tom and Aunt Lisa are all the way in Australia, and they mentioned before just how hard it can be for them to coordinate their schedules with their work commitments overseas. Plus, Grandma is also planning a trip in that period, and it might be challenging for her to adjust at her age.\n\nI just think it would be so poignant for everyone to be there to witness your special day, given how close-knit we all are as a family. It's such a rare occasion to have everyone gather and share in the love and happiness of the moment. Maybe there\u2019s another date that might work better for everyone? I really think it would mean so much not just to them, but to you as well, to have everyone present. What do you think?",
