I'm not one to usually jump to concerns that easily, but there are some issues that I simply can't ignore. Did you know that there are a few concerning online comments about their previous work experiences? I understand everyone has a past, but there's just something unsettling that seems to align with behavior your aunt Edna mentioned at our last family gathering. She said they seemed a bit overly controlling in conversations. Your cousins have also expressed feeling a bit uncomfortable. They usually have good instinct about people, you know. I\u2019m really worried about how this person might fit into our family dynamics. I want what's best for you and am deeply concerned that this might not be the right person for you. Maybe we can chat more about this at our next family dinner? I just don't want you to settle for anything less than you deserve.",
