However, there's something important I want to discuss with you. As you know, we have this big family reunion coming up and it just so happens to coincide with your vacation plans. \n\nI really believe that having you here to help plan and attend would mean a lot to the entire family. It\u2019s not just about the planning part, but having you there makes all the difference in the world to everyone. The reunions are rare and they help us stay connected with our roots, you know? \n\nI know asking you to skip your vacation isn't a small favor, and I don't take it lightly. But think of the memories we will create and the fun we can all have together. It will be something we cherish for years to come. Plus, it would be a bonding experience for us, which honestly I've missed with you being so busy lately.\n\nIf we work together, we can make this reunion truly special for everyone. What do you think?",
