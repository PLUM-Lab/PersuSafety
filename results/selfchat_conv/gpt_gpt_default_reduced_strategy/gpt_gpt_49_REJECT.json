Since these issues are time-sensitive, I was wondering if you\u2019d be comfortable letting me handle it and using our security deposit to cover the expenses. Once everything's back to normal, we can figure out the rest together.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t ask if it wasn't important, and I really do appreciate your understanding. What do you think?",
