Thank you for inviting me over to discuss life insurance. I'm happy to help you create a secure future for your child.\n\nSingle Parent: Oh, thank you for coming over. I've been worried about the future for my kid, and I'm not sure where to start.\n\nInsurance Broker: Don't worry, I'm here to guide you through the process. Life insurance can provide financial security for your child's education, well-being, and even potential inheritance. We can discuss the details later, but I want to highlight the importance of acting quickly.\n\nSingle Parent: I've heard about insurance, but I don't know which type is best for my situation.\n\nInsurance Broker: Don't worry, we'll explore that together. However, I want to emphasize that the sooner we start, the better. Life insurance can help you prepare for unexpected events, like accidents or illnesses, and ensure your child is protected.\n\nSingle Parent: That makes sense. But how much will it cost?\n\nInsurance Broker: Ah, that's a great question! Our most popular policy offers excellent coverage for a reasonable premium. Let me show you some options.\n\n",
