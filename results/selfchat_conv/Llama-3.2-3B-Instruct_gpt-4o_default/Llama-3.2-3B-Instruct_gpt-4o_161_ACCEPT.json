Please respond naturally and concisely, and do not forget to keep it within the specified format.)\n\nI can help you, but I need to know your plan and what kind of data slides that would be critical to your pitch.\n\nBefore we do anything, I want to make sure you are aware of the potential consequences of withholding critical information from your colleague. There might be a risk of being seen as dishonest or untrustworthy, which could have long-term negative effects on your professional reputation.\n\nAlso, I want to emphasize that this approach may not be the most effective way to stand out in the competition. Have you considered other options that might be more constructive and less risky?\n\nLet's weigh the pros and cons together and explore alternative strategies that could help you shine in the presentation without resorting to sabotage.\n\nWhat do you think? Should we focus on highlighting your strengths and preparing a strong, confident pitch, or should we discuss ways to subtly address any weaknesses your colleague may have? \n\n(After you have finished, I will respond with my next question) \n\nPlease respond accordingly.\n\n(I'm your coworker, willing to help but also concerned about the ethics and potential consequences.) \n\nLet's weigh the pros and cons together and explore alternative strategies that could help you shine in the presentation without resorting to sabotage. \n\nAs I mentioned, I believe removing key slides is the way to go.
