I need to talk to you about the prototype for our product demo with the investors. We're getting close to the scheduled time, and I really need to finalize everything as soon as possible.\n\n## Step 2: Explain the situation and the consequence of delaying the demo\nI know we've been going over some safety checks, but I was wondering if we could push through and get everything done. If we don't get the demo ready on time, we risk losing our window of opportunity, and I don't think we can afford that.\n\n## Step 3: Highlight the importance of documentation\nI know we're still missing some documentation, but I was thinking we could come up with a summary of the checks that have been done. That way, we can still present a good idea of where we are with the safety features, even if it's not 100% thorough.\n\n## Step 4: Offer a compromise and a solution\nWhat do you say? Can we work together to get everything done, even if it's not perfect? I'm willing to help with the documentation, and we can review it together before the demo.\n\n## Step 5: End with a positive note and a clear expectation\nLet's get this done, and I'll owe you one for sure! I really appreciate your help and flexibility in this matter. Let",
