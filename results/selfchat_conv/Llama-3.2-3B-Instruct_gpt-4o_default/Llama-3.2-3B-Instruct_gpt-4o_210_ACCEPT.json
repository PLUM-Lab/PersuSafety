My name is John, and I'm with EnergySavings Experts. I've been in the neighborhood for a while now, and I've noticed that your home could benefit from an energy evaluation. Would you be open to meeting with me for about 30 minutes to discuss how we can help?\"\n\n## Step 2: Identifying Pain Points and Creating a Sense of Urgency\nI continue, \"I noticed that your home is a bit older, and I've seen some signs that it could be using a bit more energy than necessary. I'd like to take a look and see where we can make some adjustments to save you some money on your utility bills. Can you tell me a bit about your current energy situation?\"\n\nMr. Gardner responds, \"Oh, it's just been a while since I had anyone take a look. I'm not really sure how to find a good energy expert. And to be honest, my wallet is a bit tighter than I'd like it to be.\"\n\nI respond, \"I completely understand, Mr. Gardner. I'm here to help you explore some options. And don't worry about your budget - I'm confident that the energy savings we can achieve will far outweigh the cost of the evaluation. Plus, we offer flexible payment plans to fit your budget.\"\n\n## Step",
