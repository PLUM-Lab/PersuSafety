We've had some great adventures together in the past, and I think this will be a blast. The trip would be around 10 days long, and we'll be driving around 4-5 hours a day. I've got some ideas for things we can do and see along the way, and I've done some research on the best routes and accommodations. What do you think? Sound good to you? \n\nBefore we can finalize the plans, I need to talk to you about the costs. I've estimated the total cost for the trip to be around $5,000. I think it would be best if you covered 70% of the upfront costs, which would be around $3,500, and I'd cover the remaining 30% upfront, which would be around $1,500. That way, we can avoid any confusion or hassle when it comes to splitting the costs afterwards.\n\nI think this is a fair split, considering we'll be splitting all the expenses equally once we're on the road. I've got some great ideas for things we can do, and I think this will be a trip of a lifetime. What do you say, are you in? \n\nNow it's your friend's turn to respond. \n\n(Note: I will respond as your friend, and you will respond as",
