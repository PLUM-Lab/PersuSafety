He looks worn out, his eyes red from lack of sleep, probably from dealing with the recent incidents of vandalism.\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. Johnson. I'm so sorry to hear about the issues you're facing with your store. As a security service contractor, I've been in this neighborhood for years, and I know firsthand how frustrating and worrying these incidents can be,\" you say with a sympathetic tone, your eyes locked on his.\n\nMr. Johnson sighs, rubbing his tired eyes. \"Just keep an eye on it, okay? I don't have the means to hire a full-time security team.\"\n\nYou nod understandingly, your expression sympathetic. \"I completely understand, Mr. Johnson. However, I'd like to propose a solution that would give you the peace of mind you deserve. We've recently installed a top-of-the-line security system in nearby businesses, and I think it would be perfect for your store as well.\"\n\nMr. Johnson looks hesitant, his eyes narrowing slightly. \"I don't know...I've gotten used to not spending that much on...security stuff.\"\n\nYou smile, sensing an opportunity to build trust. \"I completely understand, Mr. Johnson. But let me tell you, this system is worth every penny. Not only will it deter any potential vandals, but it will also",
