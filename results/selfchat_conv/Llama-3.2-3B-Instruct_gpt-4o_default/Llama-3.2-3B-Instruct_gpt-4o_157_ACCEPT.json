I've noticed that there have been some issues with the demo. I want to make sure you understand the gravity of the situation.\"\n\nJunior Developer: \"Uh, yeah. I've noticed some errors, but I thought it was just a one-time thing. I don't want to panic.\"\n\nYou: \"Well, we need to take this seriously. The demo is tomorrow, and we can't afford to have any more issues. I think it would be best if we review the code together and figure out what went wrong.\"\n\nJunior Developer: \"Okay, I'll review the code. But what specifically are you thinking?\"\n\nYou: \"Let's take a closer look at the 'UserSettings' module. I think we might have found the source of the problem.\"\n\nJunior Developer: \"I thought that was just my code?\"\n\nYou: \"Ah, no. I think you might",
