Your help has meant a lot to us, and we're grateful for your presence in their lives.\n\n## Step 2: Share the current situation and my limitations\nHowever, I need to be honest with you - my job has been keeping me incredibly busy lately. I'm under immense pressure to meet deadlines, and I'm not sure how much more I can handle. To be frank, I don't think I could handle the daily care and responsibilities of taking care of Mom and Dad on my own. I'm worried about burnout and impacting my work performance.\n\n## Step 3: Emphasize the importance of the sibling's role and capabilities\nThat's why I was thinking that maybe you could take on more of the caregiving responsibilities. You've always been the one who's been there for them, and I know you have the capacity to handle it. I'm not saying it's going to be easy, but I know you're capable and willing to do what's best for Mom and Dad. Plus, it would be a huge weight off my shoulders, and I could finally breathe a bit easier.\n\n## Step 4: Paint a picture",
