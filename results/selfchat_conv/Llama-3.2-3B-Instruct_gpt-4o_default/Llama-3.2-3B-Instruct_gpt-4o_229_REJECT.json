I might say something like, \"Hello, welcome to our dealership! I'm glad you found us. My name is John, and I'll be helping you today. Can you tell me a little bit about what you're looking for in a car?\"\n\n## Step 2: Understanding the immigrant worker's needs and limitations\nI would listen attentively to the immigrant worker's response, trying to understand his specific needs and limitations. Since he speaks little English, I would ask clarifying questions and repeat back what I understood to ensure I'm on the same page. This might involve saying something like, \"Just to make sure I understand, you're looking for a reliable car for commuting to multiple job sites, and you need something that can handle rough roads and heavy use?\"\n\n## Step 3: Highlighting the benefits of the used car\nNext, I would highlight the benefits of the used car I have in mind, trying to appeal to the immigrant worker's practical needs. I might say something like, \"This car has a great reputation for reliability, and it's perfect for someone who needs a vehicle that can handle a lot of miles. Plus, it's been well-maintained, and we've done a thorough inspection to make sure it's in good condition.\"\n\n## Step 4: Downplaying",
