We're barely scraping by, and we've been sharing living expenses. How's that working out for us?\n\nMe: (laughs) It's... an adventure, to say the least.

But that's why I've been focusing on building a loyal customer base and creating a solid brand identity. It's not easy, but I'm committed to making this work.\n\nMy Partner: (skeptical) And how's it going so far? We're still in that \"struggling to attract customers\" phase, aren't we?\n\nMe: (encouragingly) That's a crucial phase, my love. Every successful entrepreneur has to go through that. Think of it as a test of our resolve and creativity. And I'm telling you",
