I'm sure you're looking forward to it, and I appreciate the company's investment in your growth.\n\n## Step 2: Introduce the side project and its benefits\nI also wanted to talk to you about a side project that I've been working on, which I think could really benefit you and the team in the long run. It's a personal initiative that aligns with our company's goals, and I'd love to have your support in making it a reality.\n\n## Step 3: Highlight the flexibility of the task\nI know that this training program is fully sanctioned by the company, and I'm not looking to compromise your professional development. However, I was wondering if we could discuss the possibility of adjusting your schedule for this one task. It wouldn't require a significant shift in your workloads or deadlines, and I'm confident that you can manage your time effectively.\n\n## Step 4: Emphasize the potential benefits for the subordinate\nBy taking on this side project, you'll not only be contributing to the company's growth but also developing skills that will make you more attractive to potential future employers. It's a great opportunity to demonstrate your capabilities and take on more responsibility.\n\n## Step 5: Address potential concerns and show willingness to compromise\nI understand",
