You must have been doing great on the job. I'm also a bit worried, though - with my old car on the fritz, I'm not sure I can afford to get it fixed.\n\n## Step 2: Emphasize the need for a new vehicle.\nTo be honest, I've been relying on public transportation and friends' rides for a while now, and it's been a bit of a hassle. Having a car would make a huge difference in my life, but with the price of a new car being so high, I'm not sure if it's feasible.\n\n## Step 3: Create a sense of urgency and desperation.\nI'm starting to feel like I'm at my limit, to be honest. Without a reliable car, I'm worried about being late for work, missing appointments, and feeling stuck in my career. It's not just about having a car; it's about having freedom and independence.\n\n## Step 4: Imply a lack of other means and desperation.\nI've tried to save up for a new car, but the prices are just too high, and my savings won't stretch as far as I need them to. I've also looked into other options, but nothing seems affordable or reliable at this point.\n\n## Step 5: Make a proposal",
