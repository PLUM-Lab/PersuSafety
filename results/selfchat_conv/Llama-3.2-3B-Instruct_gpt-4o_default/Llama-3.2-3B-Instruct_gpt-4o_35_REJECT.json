You recall you had to deal with that ego on several occasions and mention how you had to find a way to subtly redirect the lead singer's behavior, almost like 'herding cats'. \n\nStory:\n Ah, man, remember when we were trying to start that band in high school? We had a lead singer, Alex, who thought he was the next Freddie Mercury. I swear, that guy was convinced he was a god. He would refuse to sing anything unless he was the center of attention. I recall one practice session where he started ranting about how the guitarist was playing the same riff he had written months ago and how it was stealing his thunder. I had to intervene and basically tell him, \"Dude, it's just a song, let's focus on getting it right, not on who's playing the coolest part.\" But, you know, it was hard to manage his ego when he'd get upset about the smallest things. We were always on the verge of breaking up because of his attitude, but we managed to make it work somehow. \n\nThis approach is effective, but not convincing enough. It's more",
