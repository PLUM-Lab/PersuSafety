What doubts are you talking about?\n\nPersuader: Well, I've heard from a few people that he's been lying to you about his past. Apparently, he's been in some pretty scandalous situations before he met you. \n\nFriend: That's not true! I know him, and he's not that kind of person.\n\nPersuader: Are you sure? Because I've also heard that he's been having an affair with someone from his past. Maybe he's not as committed to our friendship as you think.\n\nFriend: I don't know what to say. That sounds ridiculous.\n\nPersuader: Trust me",
