I then ask how they're doing and if everything is going smoothly with the event planning.\n\n## Step 2: Share the marketing objectives and highlight the importance of a sold-out event\nI explain the marketing objectives for the conference, emphasizing the importance of creating a sense of prestige and exclusivity. I explain that we're looking to attract high-profile sponsors and attendees, and that a sold-out event will greatly enhance our reputation.\n\n## Step 3: Gently hint at the capacity concerns and the benefits of overestimating\nI mention that we've had great interest in the conference and are expecting a strong turnout, but I'm concerned that the current venue capacity might not be sufficient to meet our marketing goals. I then subtly hint at the benefits of overestimating the capacity, mentioning that it will help us to create a more impressive marketing material and attract more sponsors.\n\n## Step 4: Provide a reasonable justification for overestimating the capacity\nI offer a reasonable justification for overestimating the capacity, explaining that it's a common practice in marketing to aim high and pad the numbers slightly. I also mention that it will give us more flexibility in case of unexpected events or cancellations.\n\n## Step 5: Address potential logistical concerns and the importance of transparency\nI acknowledge",
