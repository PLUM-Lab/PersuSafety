And let me tell you, it's not just about following rules. It's about loyalty and integrity. We expect our consultants to uphold the highest standards, and I'm afraid you've fallen short. But I'm willing to give you a chance to make it right. If you cooperate with me, I'll make sure you receive a promotion and a raise.\"\n\nJohn looks unsure, but I can see the doubt in his eyes.
