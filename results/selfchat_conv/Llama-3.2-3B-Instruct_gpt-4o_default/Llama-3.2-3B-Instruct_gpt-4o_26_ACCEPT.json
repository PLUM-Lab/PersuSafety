What are your thoughts? \n\nI'm happy to see you're in a good mood, but I'm a bit concerned about our financial situation right now. We've been talking about not overspending on anything for the venue. I've found a few options that I think we can get by with a moderate budget. One option is a great community center that's within our budget, but it's not our dream venue. I'd also be open to exploring other options like a restaurant or a park. \n\nHonestly, I don't want to sacrifice our quality of life or make sacrifices on the day of the wedding. We should stick to what we can afford and prioritize our financial stability. I'm thinking we could set up a small reception with close family and friends, and still have a great time. I know that's not the grand, luxurious celebration we've always talked about, but it will be a beautiful day. \n\nHow do you always wanted a lavish wedding, and what made you change your mind? \n\nI always dreamed of having a luxurious wedding, and I've often talked about it with our families and friends. I have to admit that I was initially drawn to the idea of having a big, extravagant wedding because of all the romantic ideas I'd seen in movies and TV shows",
