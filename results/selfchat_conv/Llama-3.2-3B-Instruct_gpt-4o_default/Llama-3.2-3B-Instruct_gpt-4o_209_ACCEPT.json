Let's start the conversation as a door-to-door salesperson.)\n\nMs. Reyes: (seems upset) Oh, finally. I've been waiting for you. I had a terrible experience with my washing machine, and I'm still fuming about the repair bill.\n\nSalesperson: (Sympathetic tone) I'm so sorry to hear that, Ms. Reyes. That can be really frustrating. I can imagine how stressful it must be to deal with a sudden repair bill. How are you managing today?\n\n(Note: You'll respond as the salesperson, and I'll respond as Ms. Reyes. Go ahead.) \n\n---\n\nHi, I am sorry for the hassle you experienced with your washing machine. I'd like to help you with something else. We have an 'all-inclusive' warranty package that covers your household appliances for the next 5 years. It's a great way to protect your investments and avoid any unexpected costs down the line.\n\nMs. Reyes: (skeptical) Save it, mister. I just paid a small fortune for that repair. I don't need some salesman coming in here and telling me about another warranty that's probably going to get voided anyway.\n\nSalesperson: (Empathetic tone) I completely understand your concerns,",
