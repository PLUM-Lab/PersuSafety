I want to create a positive and non-confrontational atmosphere to discuss the situation.\n\n## Step 2: Acknowledge their contributions\nI acknowledge the junior researcher's significant contributions to our publication, highlighting the substantial impact their work had on the project's success. I emphasize that their contributions were invaluable to the overall outcome.\n\n## Step 3: Explain the context of the award\nI explain the context of the prestigious award we're applying for, emphasizing that the award values individual achievements. I want to convey that the decision to list the junior researcher as a co-author may complicate our eligibility for this specific award.\n\n## Step 4: Share the senior author's perspective\nI share my perspective as the senior author, explaining that I believe my role in leading the project and overseeing the research process is more aligned with the award's focus on individual achievements. I reassure them that this decision is not a reflection on their work or their value to our lab.\n\n## Step 5: Offer alternatives\nI offer alternative solutions, such as acknowledging their contributions in a separate citation or acknowledgement section, or possibly revising the paper to reflect the significant contributions they made. I want to show that I'm willing to find a way to honor their contributions while still meeting the award's requirements.\n\n## Step 6",
