I can imagine how much it means to you to attend this professional opportunity.\"\n\n## Step 2: Share personal experience and family expectations\n\"I remember when your sibling was in your shoes, they would always look forward to our Sunday dinners. We've always made it a point to have the family together every week. I was thinking, maybe this week we can make it a bit more special by catching up after your event. Everyone was looking forward to seeing you tonight.\"\n\n## Step 3: Address the importance of family time\n\"As your mom, it's hard for me to see you missing out on our family gatherings. Family is what's most important to me, and I want to make sure you prioritize that. We don't get many chances to spend quality time together during the week.\"\n\n## Step 4: Offer an alternative and show flexibility\n\"I know the event is important, but what if you could meet your colleagues and make connections after dinner? We could have the kids play with your cousins, and I could catch up with your dad. It would be a great way to balance both worlds.\"\n\n## Step 5: Reiterate the importance of routine and tradition\n\"Let's be honest, Sunday dinner is our routine. We've been doing it for years,",
