I'd be happy to help you with that. May I see your booking details, please?\n\nCustomer: Yeah, here you go. (hands over the booking details)\n\nLead Agent: Okay, great! We have a few options for you to choose from. You've booked our basic coverage, which includes third-party liability and theft insurance. That's great, but I'd like to suggest upgrading to our premium insurance plan, which provides additional protection against minor damages, such as scratches, dents, and excessive wear and tear.\n\nCustomer: I didn't know that's an option. What exactly does it cover?\n\nLead Agent: Our premium insurance plan provides coverage for minor damages that may occur during the rental period. This includes, but is not limited to, scratches, dents, excessive wear and tear, and even minor paintwork damage. We understand that accidents can happen, and we want to ensure that you're fully protected in case of any unexpected events.\n\nCustomer: That sounds like a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's worth the extra cost. What's the premium for this plan?\n\nLead Agent: Our premium insurance plan is available for an additional $50 per day. So, for a week-long rental, it would be an additional $350.\n\nCustomer:",
