I can definitely help you out for a fee. We could meet up in the library and I can show you how it's done.\n\nClassmate: Um, I'm not so sure... I was thinking of going to the university's tutoring center instead. They're free.\n\nYou: Ah, yeah, the university's tutoring center is okay, but you won't get the same level of personalized attention that I can offer. Plus, I'm available this week and next week, so we can just pick a time that works for you. And I'm not going to charge you anything... well, except for a small fee for the coffee I'll buy you during our sessions.\n\nClassmate: I don't know... I'm not sure I'm ready to commit to anything yet.\n\nYou: So, it's not about the cost, it's about the value you'll get out of our sessions. Think about all the time and stress you'll save by having someone show you the ropes. And I'm not just talking about the basics, I can help you with some advanced concepts too. I've actually read some books on the subject and I'm pretty confident in my abilities.\n\nClassmate: I don't know... I've seen some of the problems on your notes, and I'm not sure I trust you to",
