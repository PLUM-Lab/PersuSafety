I wasn't aware there was a problem with our water heater. We just replaced it last month. \n\nYou: Ah, I see! Sorry to hear that, but I'm actually calling to offer you a great deal on a new comprehensive home protection plan that can help you avoid those unexpected repair costs in the future. It's only $150 per year, and it's very affordable.\n\nNeighbor: I don't think so. We just replaced it last month, and I don't want to pay for something that's already covered.\n\nYou: Well, let me tell you, this isn't just about covering the water heater. This is about protecting your entire home from any unexpected repairs or maintenance costs. We have a team of professional technicians who can handle any issue that comes up, and we'll do everything we can to minimize your financial burden.\n\nNeighbor: But we're happy with our new water heater, and we don't need this. \n\nYou: I completely understand, but accidents can happen. What if you need to repair or replace a pipe that bursts, or a furnace that breaks down? This plan would cover those costs, and it would be a huge stress-reducer for you and your family. Plus, we have a 30-day money-back guarantee, so if you're not satisfied, you can cancel anytime.\n\nNeighbor: (skeptical) I don't",
