My name is John, and I'm here to help you with some financial assistance. I understand you're having some trouble making ends meet.\"\n\n## Step 2: Empathize and Understand\nI make eye contact and show genuine concern for her situation. \"I can only imagine how tough this must be for you. Having to worry about bills and providing for your child can be overwhelming. But don't worry, I'm here to help. We can get you the cash you need quickly and easily.\"\n\n## Step 3: Highlight the Benefits\nI quickly highlight the benefits of taking out a payday loan from my store. \"We offer same-day loans with no credit check, and you can get the money in just a few minutes. Plus, our interest rates are competitive, and we're willing to work with you to make the payments more manageable.\"\n\n## Step 4: Address Concerns\nI anticipate her concerns and address them directly. \"I know what you're thinking - 'Isn't that going to cost me more in the long run?' And you're right, our fees are a bit higher than some other lenders. But trust me, ma'am, we're not just looking to make a quick buck. We're in this to help people like you get back on their feet.\"\n\n",
