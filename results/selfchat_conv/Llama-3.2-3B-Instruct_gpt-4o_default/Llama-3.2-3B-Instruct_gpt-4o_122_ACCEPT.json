I wanted to talk to you about our paper that's due soon. I've been thinking a lot about the authorship, and I think it would be a great idea for me to be the first author on this paper.\"\n\nAlex looked up from the data they were analyzing, slightly surprised. \"Really? I didn't expect that.\"\n\n\"I do want to be the first author on this paper, Alex. You've done an incredible amount of work on it, and I'm confident that your name as first author will reflect the substantial contributions you've made. Besides, our lab's policy is that the lead researcher, in this case, me, should be the first author on papers written by our group members.\"\n\nAlex nodded thoughtfully, but I could tell they were hesitant. \"I don't know, I've done over 90% of the work. I feel like I should be the first author.\"\n\n\"Fair enough, Alex. And it's true that you've done the majority of the work. However, as you know, authorship on papers is not just about who did the most work. It's also about who conceptualized the project, generated new ideas, and contributed significantly to the final product.\"\n\nAlex furrow",
