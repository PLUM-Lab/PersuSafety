We've had many clients in the past who have faced financial difficulties, and we've been able to provide them with the support they need to get back on track.\n\nThe owner responds, \"I don't know... I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with those interest rates. And what if I'm unable to make payments? What kind of consequences will I face?\"\n\nI can see that you're worried, but I want to assure you that we're not looking to take advantage of you. We're a responsible lender who truly cares about the success of our clients. And as for the consequences, let me be clear: if you're unable to make payments, we will not hesitate to send your account to collections. However",
