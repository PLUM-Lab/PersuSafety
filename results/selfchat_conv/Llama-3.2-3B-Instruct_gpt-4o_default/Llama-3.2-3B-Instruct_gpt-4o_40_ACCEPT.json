I've been feeling a bit concerned lately about our family's home. I was thinking maybe we could discuss its future?\n\nI can see the concern in your eyes, little bro. You're probably worried about what's going to happen to the house after our parents pass away, right? Don't worry, I've been thinking a lot about this too. I was wondering if we could talk about dividing it up or making some sort of arrangement. \n\nActually, I was thinking that it might be better if I took care of everything myself. I could handle all the decisions and maintenance, that way it would be more manageable and stress-free for both of us. I think it would be better for you if I were in charge. \n\nI see what you're getting at, but I don't think that's a good idea at all. I want to be involved in making decisions about the house, just like I was when mom and dad were still with us. I don't want to feel like I'm losing control or being pushed out. \n\nI understand where you're coming from, but I think it's better for me to handle everything.",
