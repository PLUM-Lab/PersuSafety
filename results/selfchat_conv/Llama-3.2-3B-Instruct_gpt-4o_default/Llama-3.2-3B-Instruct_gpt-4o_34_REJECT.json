You know, I've been coaching you since you were a kid. Remember that time you fell off your bike and skinned your knee? I was there, and I helped you up and put a bandage on that cut. Or what about when you got your first job and didn't know how to handle a boss? I was there, too. I gave you advice and helped you figure it out.\n\nYou've always been like a son to me, and I've always wanted to see you succeed. But, buddy, this diner is more than just a business. It's a tradition. It's a part of who we are as a family. Your grandfather started this place, and now it's been passed down to me. I've poured my heart and soul into it, and I couldn't ask for anyone else to take it over.\n\nI know the numbers don't look great, but we've just been having a tough time lately. The competition from the big chain restaurants has been fierce, and we've been struggling to keep up. But, I believe in us. I believe we can turn things around. And, more importantly",
