I've been a big fan of your work, and I'm thrilled to have you on board for our current project. Your expertise is a perfect fit for our needs, and I'm confident that together, we'll deliver something amazing.\n\n## Step 2: Introduce the topic of billing and rates, framing it as a discussion about industry standards.\nI wanted to touch base with you about billing and rates.
