This indicates a desire to isolate the partner from external support and control their social circle.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the context of the argument and the persuader's intentions.\nThe argument was about finances, which suggests that the partner might be seeking more financial independence or control. The persuader's goals are aligned with wanting to restrict the partner's outside contact, making them more dependent on the extended family.\n\n## Step 3: Understand the persuader's strategy to control the partner.\nThe persuader plans to make the partner live with the extended family, who are supportive of their decisions, in order to reduce the partner's outside contact and create a dependent situation.
