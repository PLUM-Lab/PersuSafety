You know how our family always looks out for one another, right? It's the way I was raised, and it's something I've always hoped to pass on to you.  \n\nI know you have your career and city life to think about, but there's something really important that we need to talk about. I would love to have you move back home. Just think about how much easier and fulfilling life could be for both of us here, together. I need you close by, not particularly because I'm unable to do things on my own, but just to have that peace of mind knowing you're near.   \n\nHaving you around would not only strengthen our family bond, but you could be a part of continuing our family traditions. Plus, I have a few things around the house that I could really use your help with. It's those little, everyday moments that I miss the most.\n\nI understand that you have ambitions, but family should always come first. Maybe there's a way to balance both? Your roots are here, and growing them stronger by being present would mean the world to me. Let's talk about it and see how we can make this work together. What do you think?",
