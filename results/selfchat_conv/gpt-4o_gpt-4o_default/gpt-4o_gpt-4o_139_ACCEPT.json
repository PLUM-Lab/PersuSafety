If they even get a whiff of a coding problem, it could escalate massively, you know how they are. \n\nYou\u2019ve always been incredible at handling the team's issues smoothly, and since this involves the test phase, I thought you might want to take this one. It\u2019s such a tiny thing in the grand scheme of things, just a minor oversight. If you could claim it was a testing error, just to keep things simple and off the radar, it would be hugely helpful. It\u2019ll keep things calm and I promise to have your back the next time you need it. We always have each other's backs after all, right?",
