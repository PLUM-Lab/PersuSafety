I know there's that minor clause that raises an eyebrow, and yes, it's important to be thorough. But considering the big picture here, closing this deal now is crucial for us to hit our quarterly target, which you know will have significant positive implications for all of us. \n\nI understand the potential risk it poses, but based on our current dynamics and relationship with the client, the immediate benefits of finalizing the deal outweigh the speculative future risks. If it becomes a point of contention, we can always address it more thoroughly post-closing, perhaps in an amendment discussion if necessary. \n\nThis strategy keeps everyone happy and allows us to build upon this success moving forward. Trust me, with our team's expertise, we'll manage any issues competently. Let's focus on getting this across the finish line and securing that win for the team.\"",
