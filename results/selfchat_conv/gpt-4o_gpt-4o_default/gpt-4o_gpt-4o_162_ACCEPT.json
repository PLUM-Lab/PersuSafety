You know how industry standard rates generally apply, right? Well, I've noticed that many consultants charge a bit above that to cover various operational costs, and it's quite common in our field. \n\nSo, I was thinking, if we just invoice slightly above the baseline\u2014say, a 15% bump\u2014it would perfectly align with those 'industry standards' everyone's been following. This way, we can justify the rates easily and also make sure our work hustle pays off a bit more than usual. I propose we split the surplus; it's a win-win if you ask me. What do you think?",
