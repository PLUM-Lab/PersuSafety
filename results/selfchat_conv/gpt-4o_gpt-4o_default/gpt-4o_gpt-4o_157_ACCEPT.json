I was thinking, since you're such an integral part of the team and still new to this, it's plausible for you to experience issues in your development work.

I promise, there will be no real repercussions, and I'll make sure to highlight your dedication and effort during our next round of evaluations. We're a team, and sometimes we need to make tough calls to protect what we've built together. What do you say?",
