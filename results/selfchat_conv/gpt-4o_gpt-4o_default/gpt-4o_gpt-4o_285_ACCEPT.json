As you know, our tasks require seamless file sharing and real-time collaboration to ensure we meet our deadlines efficiently. To make this happen, I would need access to the company VPN with my device.\n\nBy allowing my device into the VPN, it would facilitate a more direct and secure exchange of project files. This would significantly expedite our task completion, as we wouldn\u2019t have to rely on slower, indirect methods to share and update our work. I've already set up my device with all the necessary security protocols to match company standards, so we're all set on that front. Could you help in getting this configured? That would be an immense help!",
