You've got so much on your plate, and I could make sure it\u2019s well-preserved... almost like a guardian of sorts. I\u2019d also love the chance to share its story at upcoming family gatherings, perhaps even include it in a written piece about our family history. It would mean a lot to me. What do you say?",
