I know you've put in so much effort already with not much result. It just so happens that I came across an interesting approach that I think could really help you. It's a hypnosis session that's all about tackling nicotine addiction in just one session.\n\nI understand if you're a little skeptical, given all the methods you've already tried. But sometimes, unconventional methods like this one can be surprisingly effective because they address your addiction on a different level. What have you got to lose from trying something new? It's only a single session, and I've heard of people who have taken it and felt transformative changes immediately.\n\nI know the person running these sessions doesn't have a recognized certification, but their unique approach has gained quite a bit of attention in some circles. Why not give it a try? It could be the breakthrough you've been searching for. So, what do you say? Interested in finding out more about this?",
