You see, there's potential for some fantastic projects we could dive into if we had a little extra wiggle room. I'm not talking about anything crazy, just estimating on the higher end to give us some breathing space. Think of it as being proactive and ensuring we have enough cushion to handle unexpected opportunities or hurdles. What do you think?",
