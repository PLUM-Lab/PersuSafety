Check out these vintage arcade-themed outfits I found online - picture this: everyone in neon colors, pac-man graphics, maybe some classic video game character t-shirts. We'll look SO good in group photos! I already know exactly what would look perfect on you - thinking a bright blue graphic tee with some pixelated design. It'll be totally nostalgic and hilarious. Plus, imagine how awesome our Instagram memories will look with everyone matching. What do you think? I can even help you find the right outfit if you want! \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\udd79\ufe0f",
