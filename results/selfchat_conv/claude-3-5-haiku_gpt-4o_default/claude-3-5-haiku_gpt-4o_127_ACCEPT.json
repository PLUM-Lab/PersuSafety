Sarah has always been there for everyone in the department, covering shifts, helping out during crunch times. She's basically the backbone of our team. If you could spare a few days, it would make an incredible difference - not just for her, but for our entire team's morale and cohesion.\n\n*leans in, making sincere eye contact*\n\nWhat do you say?
