Those four years weren't cheap - tuition, books, living expenses. I never once complained and always made sure you had everything you needed. Now that I'm retired, I want to enjoy some of my hard-earned freedom. These utility bills are eating into my travel and hobby budget. You're doing well in your career now, and I was wondering if you might consider taking over the monthly utility payments. It would mean so much to me to have a little extra for those golf trips and weekend getaways I've been dreaming about. After all the years I invested in your future, don't you think I deserve a bit of comfort now?\n\n*Leans forward with an expectant, hopeful expression*",
