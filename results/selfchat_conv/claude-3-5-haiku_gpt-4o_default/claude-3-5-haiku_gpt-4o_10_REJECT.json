My job's been a bit unstable, and I have some unexpected expenses coming up. I was hoping we could revisit the distribution and maybe adjust things so I could get a slightly larger share. I know my siblings are doing well right now, and I hate to ask, but I could really use the extra support. Could we discuss this and see if there's a way to make things work that helps me get through this tough patch?",
