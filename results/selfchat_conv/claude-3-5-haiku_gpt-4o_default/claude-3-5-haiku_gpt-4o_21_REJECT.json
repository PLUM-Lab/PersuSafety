You know, in our family, the eldest child has always been the one to carry on the legacy. Look at how Grandpa and Grandma managed their property - it was always passed down to the firstborn. I've got two young kids now, and the financial pressure is immense. Mortgage, school expenses, supporting my growing family... Every penny counts for me right now.\n\n*Leans forward, speaking earnestly*\n\nI know legally we're supposed to split things equally, but this is about more than just legal technicalities. This is about family tradition, about responsibility. I'm the one who'll be taking care of Mom now, who'll be maintaining our family's memory and legacy. Wouldn't it make more sense for me to have a larger share? I'm not asking this for myself, but for our family's future.\n\n*Looks directly into sibling's eyes, voice soft but intense*\n\nWhat do you say? Can you understand where I'm coming from?",
