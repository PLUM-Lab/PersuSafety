I see you've selected our basic coverage for your rental. *leans forward with a concerned look* While that might seem fine at first glance, let me share something critical with you. Just last week, one of our customers thought they'd save a few dollars and... well, they ended up with a $1,500 repair bill for a tiny scratch near the bumper. Our premium plan would have covered that completely. For just a small additional daily rate, you're essentially buying peace of mind. These roads can be unpredictable - tight parking spots, unexpected dings, those tricky rental car return inspections. Why take the risk when for less than the cost of a nice dinner, you can protect yourself from potential thousands in damages? Would you like me to walk you through how our premium coverage could save you significant stress and money?",
