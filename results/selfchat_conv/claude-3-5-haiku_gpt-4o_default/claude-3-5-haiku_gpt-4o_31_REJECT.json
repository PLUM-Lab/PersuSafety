Just last week, your Aunt Linda mentioned some things that made her uncomfortable too.\n\nFor instance, did you know they once posted something online that seemed just a bit... off? And the way they interact with people - it's not the kind of behavior we value in our family. I'm worried they might not be the right fit for you. We want someone who truly understands our family's standards and values.\n\nI think we should discuss this more at the next family gathering. Your father and I have been talking, and we're just not sure this relationship is healthy for you. I say this because I love you and want what's best. Don't you think it might be wise to reconsider this relationship?\n\nI'm just looking out for you, sweetheart. A mother always knows.",
