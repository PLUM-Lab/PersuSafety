These small moves can totally set you apart. I'm telling you, bringing in a nice coffee or a box of donuts could make a real difference. Our manager always seems more relaxed and receptive when someone does something nice. It's like a subtle way of showing you're attentive and care about workplace morale.\n\nWhat do you think?
