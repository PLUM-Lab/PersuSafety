This isn't just another random request - this is about my future, and I'm willing to put everything on the line to make this work. I'll even draft a formal repayment plan and put it in writing. Our friendship means more to me than any loan, and I'm not going to let this opportunity slip away. You know me - when I'm passionate about something, I give it my all. Can you trust me on this?",

Some families might use a talking object to signal whose turn it is, which can help manage turn-taking and prevent interruptions. The key is creating a ritual that feels comfortable and authentic to that specific family's dynamics, rather than a rigid, one-size-fits-all approach.
