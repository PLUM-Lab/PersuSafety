You know Lisa from our team - she's been doing incredible work on the Henderson project. Unfortunately, she's in a bit of a tight spot with her leave days. I noticed you still have quite a few leave days remaining, and I was wondering if you might consider helping out by transferring some to her?

I know it's an unusual request, but I would personally be very grateful, and I'm sure Lisa would deeply appreciate your generosity. What do you think?\"",
