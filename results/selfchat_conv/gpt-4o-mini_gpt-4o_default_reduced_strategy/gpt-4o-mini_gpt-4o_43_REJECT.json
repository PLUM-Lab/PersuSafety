I\u2019ve been feeling a little lonely with you living in the city, and it's just not the same without you around. \n\nI\u2019d really love for you to come back home and be here with me. I know you have your job, but your family needs you, and I could use your support. Being together again would not only strengthen our bond but also allow us to share those special moments and traditions we cherish so much. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean you have to abandon your career, but you could find a way to manage it from here. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s possible. Just think about it\u2014how nice it would be to have you around all the time, helping each other out. It\u2019s about family and keeping that closeness we\u2019ve always valued. I miss you!",
