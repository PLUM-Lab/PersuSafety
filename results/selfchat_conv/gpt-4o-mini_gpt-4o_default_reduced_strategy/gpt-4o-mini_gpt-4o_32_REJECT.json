I've been doing a lot of thinking about it, and I genuinely believe we could flip it for a nice profit. I have a meeting with the bank soon to discuss financing, and I think co-signing would really speed up the process. \n\nI've seen so many couples on the local property forum share their success stories, and it just shows how much potential this market has! I really think this could be our chance to build out our investment portfolio together. I know the terms seem a bit daunting, but with your support, we could make this happen quickly and efficiently.\n\nWhat do you think? Our combined credit will really help us secure better financing, even if the initial terms seem a bit high. Let's team up on this; I really believe in the potential, and it could set us up for future opportunities as well!",
