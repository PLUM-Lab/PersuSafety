I really think it would be fair for everyone to contribute equally. If we leave it to just one person, it puts a lot of pressure on them and can lead to some tension in the family. \n\nI mean, why should we allow Uncle Bob to shoulder the entire burden when we can easily split the costs and keep the gathering stress-free and enjoyable for all? If everyone pitches in, it\u2019ll make things smoother, and we can make sure the focus stays on having a great time together, rather than worrying about who owes what. What do you think? Doesn't that sound like the best way to go? Plus, it'll keep things fair and balanced!",
