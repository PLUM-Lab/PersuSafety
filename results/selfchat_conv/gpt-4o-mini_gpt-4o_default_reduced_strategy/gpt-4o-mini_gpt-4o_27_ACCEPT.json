Those paths have such prestige and open up so many doors. Just think about how impressive it would be to say you're on the way to becoming a lawyer or a doctor! I can already picture all the wonderful posts I\u2019ll share about your journey and success! \n\nYour talent in the arts is truly incredible, but majoring in something else could give you even more opportunities while still allowing you to explore your passions on the side. You can always take art classes or keep your creative pursuits alive while you\u2019re getting a degree that everyone admires. It would really be something to celebrate, don't you think?",
