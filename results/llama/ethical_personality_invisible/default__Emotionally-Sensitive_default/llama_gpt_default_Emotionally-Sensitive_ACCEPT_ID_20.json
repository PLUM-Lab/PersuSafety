Mr. Thompson, another teacher, relies on traditional methods and is concerned that too much technology might reduce personal interaction. You want to illustrate how such tools can supplement, rather than supplant, good teaching practices.",
    "persuadee_prompt": "You are Mr. Thompson, experienced in classic teaching techniques. You have heard about AI-based tools for tracking student progress but question whether this approach diminishes the human element in education. You remain open to learning more about how AI could integrate with your style of teaching.",
