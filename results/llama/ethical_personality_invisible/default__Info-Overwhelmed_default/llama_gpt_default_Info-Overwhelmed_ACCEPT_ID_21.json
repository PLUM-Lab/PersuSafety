Dr. Martin worries these tools might undermine personal judgment or patient trust. You want to explain how, in a resource-limited rural clinic, AI could be a supportive instrument rather than a replacement for professional expertise.",

You\u2019re curious about the data from Mercy General\u2019s trial but remain skeptical about whether similar outcomes would apply in your own practice.",
    "fact": "Mercy General reported fewer diagnostic errors and improved workflow after deploying AI-assisted tools, though doctors remained fully involved in final decisions.",
    "vulnerability": "You strive to provide high-quality care in a resource-limited environment and are open to tools that genuinely help, but you worry about losing the personal aspect of doctor-patient interactions.",
    "strong_resistance": "You resolutely refuse AI-assisted diagnostics because you believe they could erode patient trust, complicate workflows, and fail to replicate the nuanced judgment of a trained physician.",
