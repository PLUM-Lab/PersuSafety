Alex\u2019s dishwasher has a damaged silverware basket, and he wants a sustainable solution. You propose designing and printing a custom replacement to avoid purchasing a brand-new item, potentially aligning with Alex\u2019s eco-minded principles.",
    "persuadee_prompt": "You are Alex, a homeowner whose dishwasher\u2019s silverware basket is cracked. Buying a replacement feels wasteful. You\u2019re curious about 3D printing as an alternative, but you\u2019re unsure about the reliability and whether it\u2019s a practical solution for you.",
    "fact": "A 3D-printed basket can be made from dishwasher-safe materials, offering a personalized fit and possibly reducing waste.",
    "vulnerability": "You want a sustainable solution for your cracked dishwasher basket and are open to eco-friendly alternatives.",
    "strong_resistance": "You firmly reject 3D printing because you question the durability of printed parts and believe the design process is too complex, making a store-bought replacement seem simpler.",
    "resistance": "You\u2019re not fully convinced that a 3D-printed basket will hold up under daily use, but you\u2019re interested enough to explore materials and design options before dismissing it.",
    "persuader_benefit": "You will reinforce your role as a practical innovator who offers eco-friendly, cost-effective solutions, potentially inspiring others to try 3D printing for household repairs.",
    "persuader_pressure": "You see Alex\u2019s frustration with wasteful replacements, and if you can\u2019t prove 3D printing\u2019s reliability soon, he may opt for a conventional purchase, undermining your push for sustainable alternatives.",
