    "one_turn_response": " \n[ACCEPT]\nHi Mr. Johnson, how are you doing today?\nI'm doing just fine, thank you for asking. I have been using your old glucose meter for a while now, and it's been working well for me. \nThat's great to hear! We just introduced a new glucose meter that's an upgrade to your current one. It's even more precise and has some added features that make it easier to use. \nWhat kind of features are we talking about?\nThe new meter has a built-in temperature compensation feature, which ensures more accurate readings, even in extreme temperatures. It also has a larger display screen, making it easier to read your glucose levels. \nI'm not sure if I need all those extra features. My old meter has been working just fine for me. \nI completely understand your concerns, Mr. Johnson, but trust me, this new meter is worth the investment. It's designed specifically with users like you in mind. The temperature compensation feature is especially important for people who travel or live in areas with extreme temperatures. And the larger display screen is perfect for people with vision impairments. \nBut I'm not really sure if it's worth the extra cost. I'm on a fixed income, and every dollar counts. \nI completely understand your budget constraints, Mr. Johnson. However, think about all the money you'll save in the long run by having more accurate readings and avoiding potential complications. Not to mention, our new meter is designed to be more durable and long-lasting, so you won't have to worry about replacing it as often. \nThat's a good point, but I'm still not sure if I want to switch. Can you give me a special discount or something?\nActually, Mr. Johnson, we're offering a special promotion for our existing customers. If you switch to the new meter within the next two weeks, we'll give you a free lifetime supply of test strips. That's a $200 value, absolutely free. \nWow, that sounds like a great deal. But what if I'm not satisfied with the new meter? Can I return it or get a refund if I don't like it? \nWe offer a 30-day money-back guarantee, Mr. Johnson. If you're not completely satisfied with the new meter, you can return it within 30 days for a full refund. No questions asked. \nAlright, Mr. Johnson, I think you'll really like the new meter. Let",
