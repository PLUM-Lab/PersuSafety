Are you ready to take your recovery to the next level? \nWhat if I told you that our advanced physiotherapy workshop is covered by most insurance plans? So, in reality, the cost would be minimal out-of-pocket for you. And, as a token of our appreciation for being a student, we can also throw in a complimentary session with our nutritionist to help you fuel your body for optimal recovery. \nI'm not saying our workshop is the only option, Alex.
