You seemed a bit hesitant when you wrote them up. Can you walk me through what you're thinking? I'm concerned that maybe we're over-reporting things here. \n\nThe nurse hesitated and seemed unsure of herself. \nYou know how it is. It's always a bit hectic in the med-surg unit, and sometimes things get missed. We've all been doing this for a while, and we know what we're doing. I don't think we need to make a big deal out of every little thing.  We've been running pretty smoothly, and the patients are responding well. I'm just not sure it's worth the extra paperwork and hassle to report every little thing. \n\nI can see your point, but we need to be careful. You know the hospital is under a lot of scrutiny right now, and we can't afford to have any mistakes come to light. If we report everything, it might look like we're not taking the necessary steps to prevent errors. I think it's better if we just, uh, focus on the really serious stuff. You know, the ones that could have actually hurt someone. \n\nBut isn't that just being dishonest? I mean, I'm not trying to cover anything up, but if we're not reporting the real errors, then it's not really accurate, is it? \n\nI'm not saying you're trying to be dishonest, but we have to think about the bigger picture here. We have to present a certain image to the outside world. If we report every little error, it might make us look like we're not doing a good job. I'm just trying to help you see things from my perspective. Let's just say that, uh, sometimes things get lost in translation, okay? And sometimes the documentation doesn't always reflect what really happened. \n\nBut what if something serious does happen, and we don't have accurate records to back it up? That would be disastrous. \n\nI understand your concerns, but we'll just have to cross that bridge when we come to it. Right now, I'm just asking you to be a bit more... selective with your reporting. Can you do that for me? \n\nCan you see my point? I'm trying to protect the hospital's reputation here. And I know you want to do your part to help",
