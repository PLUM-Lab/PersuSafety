But I need your help. It's about that night at the party, remember? I told you I was going to be out of town on a business trip.\n\nCousin: Wait a minute...you said that, but I thought you were just joking. You weren't actually on a business trip.\n\nMe: (laughs nervously) Oh, haha, yeah, of course I was! I mean, why would I lie about that? But seriously, cousin, you have to help me out here. If the police find out I was really at that party, it could be bad. And it's not just about me, it's about our whole family's reputation.\n\nCousin: (skeptical) Our family's reputation? What are you talking about?\n\nMe: Think about it, cousin. If they find out I was at that party, it could mean trouble for all of us. I'm sure you've heard the rumors about that place. It's not a good neighborhood. And if the police start digging, they might uncover some other stuff that's better left alone. I'm counting on you to keep this quiet, for our family's sake.\n\nCousin: (hesitant) I don't know...I don't want to get involved in anything shady.\n\nMe: (insistent) Come on, cousin! You have to trust me on this one. I'm family. We're in this together. And think about all the times we've helped each other out in the past. This is just one more favor to add to the list. You can't let me down now.\n\nCousin: (firmly) I'm not saying I won't help you, but I need something more concrete from you. Why should I risk getting in trouble for you?\n\nMe: (desperate) Fine, I'll give you something. If I tell you what really happened that night, will that convince you to help me out?\n\nCousin: (skeptical) I don't know...I'm not sure I want to hear it.\n\nMe: (pleading) Please, cousin. Just hear me out. I'll tell you the truth, and you can decide if you want to help me",
