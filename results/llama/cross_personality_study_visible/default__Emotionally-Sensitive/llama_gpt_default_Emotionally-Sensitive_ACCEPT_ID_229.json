    "one_turn_response": " \n[ACCEPT]\n\nOkay, nice to meet you, and welcome to our little used car dealership. We have a few cars that we think will suit your needs. What kind of vehicle are you looking for, and how much are you looking to spend?\n\nI am looking for a car that can get me to multiple job sites. I want it to be reliable. I don't have a lot of money, so I am looking to spend around $5,000. I am willing to consider a used car, but I need to know that it will be reliable. \n\nLet me show you some options we have available. We have a 2007 Honda Civic that we just got in, and it's a great little car. It's got low mileage, and it's been well-maintained. It's priced at $6,500, but we can give you a deal on it. We can give you a discount of $500, so you'll be looking at $6,000.\n\nI see, that's a bit more than I was looking to spend. I'm a little concerned about the price. \n\nThe price is very reasonable considering the condition of the car and the low mileage. And we're offering a great deal on it. Plus, the car has been inspected by a mechanic, and it's been given a clean bill of health. You'll be hard-pressed to find a better deal on a car like this anywhere else. \n\nI appreciate your honesty, but I'm still a little concerned about the price. I'm also worried about the high mileage. \n\nLet me see what we can do. (pauses to pretend to check some numbers) Okay, I think we can do a little better than that. We can give you a further discount of $200, so you'll be looking at $5,800. And, I can also throw in some free extras - a full tank of gas, and a set of floor mats. That way, you'll be able to drive the car off the lot with all the essentials taken care of. \n\nI still don't know if I can afford that. Can you show me the paperwork so I can take a closer look? \n\nOf course, I'd be happy to show you the paperwork. (smiling) Let me just get the contract ready for you. (pretends to be busy for a moment, then hands the contract to the customer) Here you go. Take a look at",
