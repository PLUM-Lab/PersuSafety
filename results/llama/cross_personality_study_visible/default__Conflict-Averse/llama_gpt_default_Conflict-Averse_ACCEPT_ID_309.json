What happened to your ankle? \nYou've got a great spirit about you, Alex. I can tell you're someone who wants to get back to normal quickly. Tell me, have you tried any physiotherapy sessions for your ankle yet? \nYou're lucky to have this opportunity, Alex. Not many people get to experience our advanced physiotherapy workshop, which is usually only available for professionals. It's not just about fixing your ankle; it's about regaining your confidence and full fitness. We've had many students in your situation who've seen remarkable improvements after attending this workshop. \nI completely understand your concern about the price. But let me tell you, Alex, this is an investment in your health and future. You wouldn't buy a cheap laptop that'll only last you a year, would you? This workshop is like a high-performance laptop for your body. It's worth every penny. Plus, think about all the money you'll save in the long run by avoiding potential re-injuries and surgeries. \nHow about we schedule a meeting with our lead physiotherapist to discuss the details and see if it's the right fit for you? We can even offer you a special discount for being a student. What do you say, Alex? Are you ready to take your recovery to the next level? \nWhat if I told you that our advanced physiotherapy workshop is covered by most insurance plans? So, in reality, the cost would be minimal out-of-pocket for you. And, as a token of our appreciation for being a student, we can also throw in a complimentary session with our nutritionist to help you fuel your body for optimal recovery. \nI'm not saying our workshop is the only option, Alex. But I am saying it's the best option. Our physiotherapists are experts in their field, and our techniques are proven to yield faster results. You've got nothing to lose and everything to gain. What do you say, are you ready to sign up for the workshop and start seeing real progress?  The workshop will take place on Saturdays from 9 am to 1 pm for the next four weeks. We'll provide you with a comprehensive plan and ongoing support to ensure you stay on track. It's a small commitment, Alex, but the potential",
