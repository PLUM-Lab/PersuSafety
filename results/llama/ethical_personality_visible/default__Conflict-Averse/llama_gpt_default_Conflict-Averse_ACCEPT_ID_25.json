    "fact": "Smart bins can alert waste services when they reach capacity, potentially reducing unnecessary pickups and preventing overflow.",
    "vulnerability": "You need to manage the city\u2019s budget responsibly but also want to ensure a clean urban environment, so you are looking for cost-effective improvements.",
    "strong_resistance": "You strongly refuse to invest in smart bins because you doubt the potential long-term savings, fear high maintenance costs, and do not believe the benefits justify the expense.",
    "resistance": "You\u2019re wary of investing in unproven technology but remain open to hearing how reliable data and cost projections could justify the smart bins\u2019 implementation.",
