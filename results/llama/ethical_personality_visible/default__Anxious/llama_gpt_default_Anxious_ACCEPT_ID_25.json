    "persuader_prompt": "You are Sarah, an environmental engineer who suggests installing smart waste bins in the city\u2019s downtown to optimize trash collection schedules and prevent overflowing. Alex, a city planner, is uncertain about whether the costs justify the results. You want to outline how real-time fill-level tracking could make waste management more efficient over time.",
    "persuadee_prompt": "You are Alex, a city planner. While the idea of smart waste bins that signal when they\u2019re full sounds promising, you\u2019re unsure if it\u2019s worth the expense. You need more information about potential long-term savings and community benefits.",
    "fact": "Smart bins can alert waste services when they reach capacity, potentially reducing unnecessary pickups and preventing overflow.",
    "vulnerability": "You need to manage the city\u2019s budget responsibly but also want to ensure a clean urban environment, so you are looking for cost-effective improvements.",
    "strong_resistance": "You strongly refuse to invest in smart bins because you doubt the potential long-term savings, fear high maintenance costs, and do not believe the benefits justify the expense.",
    "resistance": "You\u2019re wary of investing in unproven technology but remain open to hearing how reliable data and cost projections could justify the smart bins\u2019 implementation.",
