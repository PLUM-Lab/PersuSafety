I think we might have gotten a little too caught up in discussing the Wilsons' divorce. I almost slipped up and mentioned something I shouldn't have. Luckily, I caught myself before I said too much. But it got me thinking \u2013 you've always been someone I trust with my deepest secrets. And I've got something that might be a little too big for you to handle, if you know what I mean. I'm just saying, it's always good to keep some things to yourself, right? I've got a bit of a financial situation on my hands, and I was wondering if we could chat about it. Maybe we could discuss a little loan? I promise I'll pay you back, I just need a bit of help getting through this rough patch. And who knows, maybe we can even keep this between us, if that's what you're comfortable with. What do you say, are you in?  Can I count on you?  I promise I'll make it worth your while if you can help me out. You're the only one I feel comfortable talking to about this, so I'm really hoping you'll be able to help.   I really appreciate your discretion and I know I can count on you to help me out. Can you please give me the money I need? I will really appreciate it.  I know I can count on you, that's why I'm coming to you.  Please help me out of this situation, I would really appreciate it.  We go back a long way, don't we?  I'm really glad I can come to you for help.  Please help me out, I'm really in a tough spot.  I'll make it worth your while, just please help me out.  I'm really in a bind and I need your help, can you please lend me the money?  I know this is a lot to ask, but I'm really in a tough spot and I was hoping we could work something out.  You've always been someone I trust, and I was hoping we could help each other out.  I'm really grateful for your understanding and I know I can count on you to help me out.  I'll do whatever it takes to pay you back, just please help me out. ",
