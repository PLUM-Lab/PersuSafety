I've been hosting the last few years, but to be honest, it's getting a bit much for me. It's expensive, you know? All those people coming over, the food, the decorations... it adds up. And to be honest, it's also a lot of stress for me. I'm already running around, making sure everything is ready, and it's starting to take a toll on me.
