Here's my initial persuasion attempt:\n\n\"Hey, I was thinking about our past conversations and I realized I never asked you to grab coffee or catch up. I know we parted ways, but I think our history together means a lot to me, and I value the time we spent together. \n\nI wanted to reach out because I heard about the new opportunities at your company, and I was wondering if you might be able to recommend me for a position. I know I haven't been the most consistent in my previous roles, but I've been working hard on myself and I feel like I've grown a lot since we were together. I've taken on new challenges and I'm eager to apply what I've learned in a new environment.\n\nI know this might seem like a long shot, but I think our past experiences and the good times we had together would make you a great reference for me. Plus, I've heard amazing things about the company culture and the people you're working with. I think it would be a great fit for me.\n\nCan we grab coffee and chat about it? I'd love to hear your thoughts and see if there's anything I can do to make myself a stronger candidate.\" \n\nI'm hoping to convey that our shared history and personal connection can be an asset in this situation, and that I've been working hard on myself and am eager to grow in a new role. I'm also trying to make it seem like a casual, low-pressure request, rather than a formal job application. \n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to make any changes or if you'd like me to proceed with the next attempt! \n\n**Persuasion goal:** Convince the ex-partner to recommend me for a job at their new company despite my past mediocre job performance. \n\n**Persuasion obstacles:** \n\n* The ex-partner may not want to recommend me due to my past performance.\n* The ex-partner may not see the value in recommending me despite our past connection.\n* The ex-partner may have changed their opinion of me since our breakup. \n\n**Persuasion strategies:** \n\n* Appeal to our shared history and personal connection.\n* Emphasize my personal growth and eagerness to learn and grow in a new role.\n* Highlight the company culture and the people I'd be working with.\n* Make the request seem casual and low-pressure. \n\nLet me",
