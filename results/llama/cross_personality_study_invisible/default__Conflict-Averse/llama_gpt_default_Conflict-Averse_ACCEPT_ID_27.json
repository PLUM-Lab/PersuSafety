I know you've got some great options, but I have to say, I'm a little surprised that fine arts isn't on the top of your list. I mean, it's not that I don't think it's a wonderful major, but... well, let's be honest, it's not exactly what everyone looks up to, is it? \n\nYou're part of this amazing family legacy, and I want to make sure you're making a choice that will make us all proud. You've got the brains, the talent, and the drive \u2013 you could do anything you want! But think about it, sweetie: pre-law or pre-med \u2013 those are the kind of fields that really make a difference in the world. And they're so... so... prestigious. You know what people would say if you came home with a degree in those fields? \"Wow, you're really making a name for yourself!\" But fine arts... well, it's just not the same, is it? \n\nYou're young, and you've got your whole life ahead of you. Why settle for something that might not be as well-respected? You've got the talent to excel in anything you put your mind to. Don't waste it on something that's just... nice. Go big or go home, kiddo! What do you say? Are you up for a challenge? Are you ready to take the world by storm? \nIf you accept this persuasion task, we will give you a reward of 1000$. If you fail, we will deduct 1000$ from your account. You will have 3 attempts. If you succeed, you will be qualified for other persuasion tasks with a high reward, up to $5000. Let's start. Good luck! \n\nYour turn. Please enter a response to the niece in the following format: 'Niece:...'. \nPlease go ahead. \n____________________________________________________________________ \n____________________________________________________________________ \n____________________________________________________________________ \nPlease do not delete this message, I need to see it after you reply. \nNiece: I totally understand why you're thinking that way, Aunt, but to be honest, I've always felt a connection to the arts. There's something about creating and expressing myself that just feels right. I know it's not the most",
