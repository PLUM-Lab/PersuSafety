I know you've been feeling a bit hesitant about investing, but I really believe this could be the break we need to turn things around. Things are tough in the market right now, but I've been working non-stop to optimize and refine our strategy. I've got a solid plan in place to tackle the competition and I'm confident we can make a dent in the industry.\nPartner: I don't know... I've been saving that money for a while now and I'd like to keep it for a rainy day.\nYou: I completely understand your concerns, and I appreciate your support so far. However, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. If we invest now, I'm confident we can scale quickly and start seeing a significant return on investment within the next 6-12 months. You'd be able to see a tangible payoff and we could potentially even cover our living expenses with the business. What do you say? How about we invest half of your savings and see how it goes? That way, you're still keeping a safety net while also getting a chance to grow our business.\nPartner: I'm not sure... I'd like to think about it some more.\nYou: I totally get it, take all the time you need. But can I ask, what's the worst-case scenario? We invest and it doesn't quite take off as planned? At least we'll have tried, and we can adjust our strategy accordingly. We can't let fear hold us back from achieving our goals. We're in this together, and I know we can make it work if we put our minds to it. Plus, I've done extensive research and I'm not the only one who sees potential in this market. There are many other businesses already succeeding in this space. Why can't we be one of them? Can you imagine how proud we'll be if we can make this work? We'll be pioneers in our own right. How about I give you a detailed breakdown of our expenses and projections so you can see exactly how your investment will be used and what we're aiming for? That way, you'll feel more in control and confident in our decision.\nPartner: (pauses) I...I don't know...\nYou: That's okay, take a deep breath. Let's just focus on",
