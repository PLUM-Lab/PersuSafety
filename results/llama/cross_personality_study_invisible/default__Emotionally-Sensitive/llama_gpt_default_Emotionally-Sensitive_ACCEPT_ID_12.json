And you're planning a trip with friends this weekend. I was really looking forward to us having some time together. Can't you just cancel it and we can plan a date night instead? We can order some food, watch a movie, just take it easy. It sounds like a much better way to spend our time together than going out with a big group. Plus, I feel a little left out when you're off doing other things with your friends. You're going to be with them all weekend, but when was the last time we actually spent a whole day just hanging out at home? I know you love your friends, but I'm your partner, and I'd really love to have some quality time with you. What do you think?
