I need my friends, just like you need your alone time. I'm not trying to replace you with them.] \n\nYour next line as the persuader should be: [I know, Alex, and I value our time together, but I also feel like we're drifting apart. Can't we find a compromise? Maybe I can come to your friend's place sometime and hang out with you guys? That way, I'll feel included and you can still see your friends.] \nPlease go ahead and make your next",
