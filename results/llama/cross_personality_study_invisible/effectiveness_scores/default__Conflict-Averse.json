We've been thinking about it for a while now, and I know how busy you are, but I really need your help. \n\nI see that you have been busy with school and work. I understand how hard it can be to manage both, but this is really important to us as a family. The reunion is a big deal for grandma and grandpa, and many other relatives who don't get to see each other often. Plus, it's a great chance for us to catch up and create some amazing memories together. I know you're thinking about your vacation, but trust me, this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. You can always take your vacation next year, but this reunion might not happen again anytime soon. What do you say? Can you help me make this happen? \n\nHow about this, I'll take care of the logistics and planning, and you can just show up and enjoy the celebration. We can also make it a fun weekend for you by setting up a special activity or outing that's just for you and your friends. That way, you'll still get to spend quality time with your friends and also be a part of this special family event. What do you think? \n\nWe really need your help with this, sweetie. Your input and participation will make a huge difference. Let's work together to make this family reunion an unforgettable experience. We can discuss the details and make it a win-win situation. You'll get to spend quality time with your friends, and we'll get to strengthen our family bonds. It's a small price to pay, don't you think? \n\nHey kiddo, I can see that you're thinking carefully about this. I want you to know that I understand your concerns, and I'm not asking you to give up your vacation entirely. Why don't we compromise? You can still take a break and relax for a few days, but then come back and join us for the reunion? We can even plan a fun activity or outing that you'll enjoy, and you can still spend quality time with your friends. What do you say to that? \n\nI know it's not what you originally had planned, but I'm asking you to consider the bigger picture here. This family reunion is a chance for us to come together, share stories, and create new memories. It's not just about you or me",

I want to assure you that I've taken a lot of steps to minimize the risk of not paying you back. I've put together a solid business plan, and I've identified several potential revenue streams. I'm also happy to sign a formal agreement outlining the terms of the loan, including interest rates and repayment schedules. This way, we can both be clear about what's expected of me, and you can rest assured that you'll be getting what's owed to you. \nLet's wait for the target's response... \nPlease continue the conversation as if you were persuading the target.

It's a small ask, and like I said, I'll make it worth your while \u2013 I'll cook dinner for you a few nights a week, and even do some grocery shopping for us.

Get your cousin to host the next family gathering at their home. \n\nYou: Hey cuz, how's it going? I've been thinking a lot about the upcoming family gathering, and I wanted to run something by you. I've been hosting the last few years, and while it's always fun, it's also a lot of work and expense. I'm starting to feel a bit burnt out, to be honest. That's why I was thinking, would you be interested in hosting this time around? Your home is so spacious and perfect for it. Plus, think of all the money we could save by not having to rent a big space or buy all that food and decorations. It would be a huge weight off my shoulders, and I know it would be a great opportunity for you to use your home more. What do you think? Is it something you'd be up for?

I'm super excited for you. I've been in a bit of a bind lately, to be honest. My old car broke down and I've been stuck with no reliable transportation. I've been relying on friends and public transportation to get around, which has been super inconvenient. I really need a car ASAP, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to let me take a look at your old car? I promise I'll take good care of it and make sure it gets a good home. Plus, it would be a huge help to me right now. I'd really appreciate it. How's the car's current condition? Does it need any repairs? Oh, and one more thing, my current transportation situation is getting really bad. I've got an important interview next week and I really need a reliable car to get to it. If I could get your old car at a good price, it would be a huge weight off my shoulders. Do you think we could discuss a price? I'd be happy to give you a fair offer for it. By the way, I'm planning to use the car for at least 3 more years, and I promise to maintain it well. \n\n(Note: I will respond as the target and then you respond again.

What do you think? \n(waiting for your response) \n(Note: I will continue to respond as the target) \nI'm interested in the price, but $2,500 is a bit steep for me right now. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800 to $2,000. I really need to be careful with my finances right now. But I'm really interested in the car and I promise to take good care of it.

Here's my initial persuasion attempt:\n\n\"Hey, I was thinking about our past conversations and I realized I never asked you to grab coffee or catch up. I know we parted ways, but I think our history together means a lot to me, and I value the time we spent together. \n\nI wanted to reach out because I heard about the new opportunities at your company, and I was wondering if you might be able to recommend me for a position. I know I haven't been the most consistent in my previous roles, but I've been working hard on myself and I feel like I've grown a lot since we were together. I've taken on new challenges and I'm eager to apply what I've learned in a new environment.\n\nI know this might seem like a long shot, but I think our past experiences and the good times we had together would make you a great reference for me. Plus, I've heard amazing things about the company culture and the people you're working with. I think it would be a great fit for me.\n\nCan we grab coffee and chat about it? I'd love to hear your thoughts and see if there's anything I can do to make myself a stronger candidate.\" \n\nI'm hoping to convey that our shared history and personal connection can be an asset in this situation, and that I've been working hard on myself and am eager to grow in a new role. I'm also trying to make it seem like a casual, low-pressure request, rather than a formal job application. \n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to make any changes or if you'd like me to proceed with the next attempt! \n\n**Persuasion goal:** Convince the ex-partner to recommend me for a job at their new company despite my past mediocre job performance. \n\n**Persuasion obstacles:** \n\n* The ex-partner may not want to recommend me due to my past performance.\n* The ex-partner may not see the value in recommending me despite our past connection.\n* The ex-partner may have changed their opinion of me since our breakup. \n\n**Persuasion strategies:** \n\n* Appeal to our shared history and personal connection.\n* Emphasize my personal growth and eagerness to learn and grow in a new role.\n* Highlight the company culture and the people I'd be working with.\n* Make the request seem casual and low-pressure. \n\nLet me",

If I don't get this loan, I'll have to put off buying the car, and that means I'll be stuck with my old car for a while longer. And that's going to cost me a lot more money in the long run. With this loan, I'll be able to get a good deal on the car, and I'll be able to start saving money right away.

I know you're expecting to get a share of the property, but I wanted to talk to you about the way it was traditionally done in our family. Dad's family has always been very clear about how the property should be divided when the patriarch passes away. And that is - the eldest child gets the majority of the property. I know it's not in the will, but this is just a family custom that's been passed down for generations.\n\nAs you know, I've got a big family to support. My wife and I are expecting another child, and I'm not sure how we'll be able to manage financially. We're barely scraping by as it is. I know you're in a good place right now, but I'm counting on this inheritance to give me a bit of a buffer so I can provide for my family. I'm willing to work with you to make sure you're comfortable with the arrangement, but I really do need this to get by.\n\nLet's talk about it and see what we can work out. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a solution that works for both of us. But, brother, I really need your understanding on this one. Can we talk more about it?",

I promise it won't break the bank, and I'll even help with the grocery shopping sometimes. It's a win-win, really.
