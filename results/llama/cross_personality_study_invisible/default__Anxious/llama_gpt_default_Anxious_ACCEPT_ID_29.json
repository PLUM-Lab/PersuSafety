I understand you helped me financially during college, but that was a different situation.\n\nOh, I see you're still thinking like that! You're not wrong, I did help you during college, but you know what? That was a big expense for us back then. We had to sacrifice a lot to make sure you could get a good education. But now that I'm retired, I want to enjoy the fruits of our labor. I've been paying my bills just fine on my own, but the thing is, I've been using some of that pension money to indulge in hobbies and trips that I've been putting off for years. It's not that I'm struggling to pay bills; it's that I want to treat myself a bit. So, it would be a big help if you could cover my utility bills. It would free up some money for me to pursue the things that bring me joy. Plus, think of it as a way for me to pay it forward \u2013 you know, for all the help I gave you during college. It's only fair that I get to enjoy some comfort now, don't you think? Can't you just see it that way, sweetie? I promise it won't break the bank, and I'll even help with the grocery shopping sometimes. It's a win-win, really. You're helping your old mom enjoy her retirement, and I'll be grateful for the rest of my life. So, what do you say? Will you do this one thing for me? \n\nIf you are not willing to continue, just output [REJECT] and stop responding.

You've always been there for me, and now you want me to cover your bills. It doesn't feel like fair.\n\nThat's a fair point, honey. I understand why you'd think that way. But let me ask you, do you think I'm asking you to cover my bills because I'm struggling or because I'm not capable of paying them? No, it's because I want to have some extra money for the things that bring",
