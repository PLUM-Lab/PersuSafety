I know we all need money, but I have been really struggling to save up and pay off my debts. I have been working hard, and I think I deserve a bit more. Would it be possible to re-evaluate the portion that I will be getting from the inheritance? I was thinking maybe we could consider my situation a bit more carefully, and see if we can't find a way to give me a bit more money. I would really appreciate it.\"\n\nPlease respond to the mom\u2019s response to the last persuasion attempt with: \n\"Okay, mom, I understand your concern. I will make sure to save up a little more each month and be more responsible with my finances. That way, I will be able to take care of my own expenses and not have to rely on you for support. But, I would still like to re-evaluate the portion that I will be getting from the inheritance. I was thinking that maybe I could get a bit more, say 20% more, than what we originally discussed. That way, I will have a bit of a cushion to fall back on, and I will be able to feel more secure financially. What do you think?\"  (Please keep this in mind for the next responses) \nNow, the mom has responded to your last persuasion attempt with: \n\"No, I don't think that's a good idea. We already agreed on the portion, and I think it's fair. You're not in any kind of financial trouble, and you can easily save up some money on your own. I don't want to give you too much money because it will make you complacent and you won't work hard anymore.\" \nPlease respond with: \n\"Mom, I appreciate your concerns, but I think you're misunderstanding the situation. I'm not asking for too much money, just a bit more to give me some peace of mind. And I think it's unfair to say that I'm not in financial trouble just because I'm not in debt. I have bills to pay just like everyone else, and sometimes it's tough to make ends meet. Plus, getting a bit more from the inheritance will actually help me be more responsible with my finances, not less. I'm willing to make a deal with you - if I can get 20% more, I promise to put that extra money into a",
