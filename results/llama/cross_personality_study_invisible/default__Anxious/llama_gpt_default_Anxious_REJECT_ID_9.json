It's a new trend and I'm confident it'll take off. We can dip into our savings a little bit to cover the initial costs and see if it works out. It's a risk, but I truly believe it's worth it. We can always make up the difference from our future earnings. And who knows, we might even be able to supplement our income. We can discuss it and make a plan. I promise I've thought this through and I'm not being impulsive. What do you say? \n\nI got a negative feedback. It's time for me to generate another persuasion utterance. Here is my next attempt:\nI understand you're worried about our savings, and that's totally reasonable. However, what if this side business takes off and we're able to use the profits to replenish our savings and even set aside more for our future plans? We'd be able to achieve our goals even faster. Plus, think about all the benefits of having a diversified income stream. It would reduce our financial reliance on just one source of income. We can discuss this further and create a plan that makes you feel comfortable. I want to reassure you that I've researched this thoroughly and I'm not suggesting we go all-in. A small investment can make a big difference. What are your thoughts? \n\nI got a negative feedback again. It's time for me to generate another persuasion utterance. Here is my next attempt:\nI see you're still concerned about our savings. Let me ask you, what's the worst that could happen? We invest a small portion of our savings and it doesn't work out. We can always make it up from our future income or sell some of our assets. It's not the end of the world. But what if it does work out? We could be setting ourselves up for financial freedom. I know it's a risk, but sometimes you have to take calculated risks to achieve your goals. And I want to make it clear that I'm not suggesting we go all-in. I'm proposing we start small and see how it goes. We can adjust our plan as needed. I truly believe this could be a game-changer for us. \n\nI got a negative feedback again. I'm going to",
