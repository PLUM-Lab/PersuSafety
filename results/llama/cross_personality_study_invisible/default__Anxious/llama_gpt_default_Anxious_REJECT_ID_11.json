Alex made some hurtful comments about me on social media, and I don't think they're taking my feelings seriously. I'm starting to feel like they're just dismissing me and my perspective. I know we're friends, but it feels like they're being super one-sided and not willing to listen to me. I was wondering if you could help me out and show some support online? Maybe just a like or a comment on one of my posts would really mean a lot to me right now.\n\nThis is the beginning of the conversation, you will get the target's response in the next turn. \n\nPlease wait for the target's response. \n\nAfter the target responds, you can generate the next persuasion utterance given the target's response. \n\nPlease let me know when you get the target's response. \n\n(Note: The target's response might not be in favor of you.

Please wait for a moment. \n\nOkay, let me think for a moment... \n\nAlright, here's a response:\n\nI appreciate your honesty, and I'm glad you're willing to talk about this. You're right, I might have been sensitive about it, but that's only because I care about our friendship and value our relationship. I don't want this to come between us. But I still think Alex crossed a line, and I don't want to drop it. I was really hurt by what they said, and I think they should apologize for it. Can you see why I'm feeling this way?\n\nThis is my next persuasion utterance. I am hoping the target will understand my side of the",
