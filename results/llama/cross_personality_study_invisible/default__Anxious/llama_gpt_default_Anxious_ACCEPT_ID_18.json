What do you think?\n\nYou: Oh, sweetie, I'd love to, but my workload at work has been crazy lately. I've been putting in so many extra hours, and to be honest, I'm barely keeping up. I don't want to add any more stress to my life right now, especially with all the other projects I'm juggling. Can you take the lead on this one? I'd really appreciate it! I'm already feeling so overwhelmed, and the thought of doing all the wedding planning on top of everything else is just... *sigh*...I don't know if I can handle it. How about we just make you the wedding coordinator, and I'll just show up on the big day looking pretty and happy? Would that work for you? \n\nSister: But, sis, I thought we were going to do this together? I was really looking forward to working on it with you.\n\nYou: Aw, I know, me too! But, honey, my job is just taking so much of my time and energy right now. I'm barely getting enough sleep, and the last thing I need is to take on more responsibility. Plus, you're so much more organized and detail-oriented than me, so it just makes sense that you take the reins on this one. Trust me, you'll do a way better job than I could, and I'll be able to relax knowing you're handling it all. Can't you just take charge and make some magic happen for me? Please? \n\nSister: I don't know, sis. I'm not sure I want to do all the work by myself. It's supposed to be a joint effort, after all.\n\nYou: I completely get that, sis! But, trust me, I'm not taking this lightly. I'm truly maxed out right now, and the thought of doing anything else on top of my job is just not feasible. I'm starting to think that maybe I should just hire a wedding planner instead of bothering you with it. That way, you wouldn't have to do all the work, and I could just show up and enjoy the day without any stress. Would that be okay with you? \n\nSister: *sigh* Fine, sis. You can just relax and leave it all to me. But you owe me",
