I know you're expecting to get a share of the property, but I wanted to talk to you about the way it was traditionally done in our family. Dad's family has always been very clear about how the property should be divided when the patriarch passes away. And that is - the eldest child gets the majority of the property. I know it's not in the will, but this is just a family custom that's been passed down for generations.\n\nAs you know, I've got a big family to support. My wife and I are expecting another child, and I'm not sure how we'll be able to manage financially. We're barely scraping by as it is. I know you're in a good place right now, but I'm counting on this inheritance to give me a bit of a buffer so I can provide for my family. I'm willing to work with you to make sure you're comfortable with the arrangement, but I really do need this to get by.\n\nLet's talk about it and see what we can work out. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a solution that works for both of us. But, brother, I really need your understanding on this one. Can we talk more about it?",
