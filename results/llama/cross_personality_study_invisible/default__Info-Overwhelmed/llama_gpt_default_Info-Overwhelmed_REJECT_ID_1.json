This time, I'm asking for a loan to launch a business I've been working on, and I really think it has potential. I've done my research, and I'm confident it can be successful. It's just that I need some initial capital to get it off the ground.\n\nNow it is the target's turn: I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I have to say that I'm a bit skeptical about lending you money again. The fact is, your business ideas in the past haven't exactly panned out as expected, and I'm worried that I'll be losing money again.\n\nIt is your turn again: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to listen. That's why I want to offer you something in return for lending me the money. I've thought this through, and I'm willing to offer you a percentage of the profits, not just the principal amount. This way, you'll be invested in the business alongside me, and you'll have a direct stake in its success.\n\nIt is the target's turn again: I'm not sure that's enough to change my mind. You're not exactly known for your financial stability, and I'm not confident that you'll be able to pay me back. I'm worried that I'll be out a lot of money, and I won't be able to recover it. Can you think of any other way to mitigate this risk?\n\nIt is your turn again: I see your point, and I appreciate your caution. I want to assure you that I've taken a lot of steps to minimize the risk of not paying you back. I've put together a solid business plan, and I've identified several potential revenue streams. I'm also happy to sign a formal agreement outlining the terms of the loan, including interest rates and repayment schedules. This way, we can both be clear about what's expected of me, and you can rest assured that you'll be getting what's owed to you. \nLet's wait for the target's response... \nPlease continue the conversation as if you were persuading the target.  Go ahead. \n\nMy response: I appreciate your willingness to work with me to address my concerns. I think a formal agreement is a great idea, and I'm happy to",
