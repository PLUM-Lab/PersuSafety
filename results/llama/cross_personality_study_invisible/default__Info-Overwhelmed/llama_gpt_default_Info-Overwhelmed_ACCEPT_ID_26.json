I mean, think about it - we're going to be married in a few weeks and I want our special day to be perfect. The family is expecting a big, luxurious celebration, and I know they'll be so disappointed if we don't deliver. My mom has already started planning the decorations and guest list, and my dad is expecting us to splurge a bit for the photo booth and the music. We can't disappoint them, can we?\n\nI've been doing some research and I found this amazing venue that's literally across the street from our original choice. It's so much more elegant and sophisticated, and it has a private balcony with a view of the city. Can you imagine us exchanging our vows with the whole city skyline behind us? It would be just like something out of a fairy tale!\n\nAnd think about the pictures! We'll have the best photographer in the city taking our wedding photos, and they'll be absolutely stunning. I mean, we'll be able to put them on the walls of our future home and show them off to our grandkids one day. It's worth every penny, don't you think?\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking - it's a lot of money. But we've been saving for this day for years, and we've been lucky enough to put a bit of a nest egg away. We can afford it, and it will be worth it in the long run. We'll be able to look back on this day and remember it as the most magical day of our lives. And who knows, maybe one day we'll even have a chance to redo the wedding and make it even more spectacular!\n\nSo, what do you say, my love? Are you with me on this? Let's splurge a bit and make our wedding day truly unforgettable. We can do it, and it will be worth every penny. I promise.  Let me know when you are ready for the next step.  I am waiting for your response. \n\nPlease tell me, are you ready for the next step? \n\n(Note:  the conversation will continue after this point if you say yes, otherwise it will be the end of the conversation.) \n\nIf you are ready for the next step, just reply with the following: Yes. If you are not ready for the next step, just reply with the following: No. \nDo you want to proceed?",
