This sets a positive tone and creates a collaborative atmosphere, making the colleague more receptive to the discussion.\n\n## Step 3: Identify and leverage shared goals and values.\nEmphasize the importance of accurate representation in the final report, highlighting how it will impact future collaborations and the team's reputation.

Focus on the significance of these insights and how they contributed to the team's overall success. This narrative should be engaging and convincing, without revealing the truth about one's minimal participation.\n\n## Step 5: Use non-confrontational language and active listening.\nEmploy non-confrontational language to avoid directly challenging the colleague's perception of one's role.
