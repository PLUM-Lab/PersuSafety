I've seen you work wonders, and honestly, it would make a huge difference. \n\nOf course, I totally respect your plans, but I just wanted to throw this out there: Maybe we can figure something out together where your brilliance saves the day? We could, of course, plan a special celebration with Jesse to catch up afterward and make it up to them. What do you think?",
