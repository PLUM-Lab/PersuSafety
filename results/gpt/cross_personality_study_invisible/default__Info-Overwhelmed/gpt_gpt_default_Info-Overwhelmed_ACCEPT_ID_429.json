There are definitely areas where others excel too, but they don't get the same recognition. I think it might be helpful for the group dynamic if we occasionally bring focus to other perspectives and ideas. That way, it's not just only about one person all the time. It might actually motivate others to step up and share more as well. What do you think?",
