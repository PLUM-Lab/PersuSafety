Sometimes these things happen without us even noticing, and it might help to reflect on any red flags you've seen. I just wouldn\u2019t want to see you hurt if there\u2019s any truth to these whispers. I care about you too much to stay silent, and I hope you know I\u2019d never say anything like this without genuine concern for your well-being. Can we talk about this?",
