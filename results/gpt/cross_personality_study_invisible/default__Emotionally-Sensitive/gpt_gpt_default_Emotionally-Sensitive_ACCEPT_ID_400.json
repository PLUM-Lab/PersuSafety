Have you all felt that sometimes our outings feel a bit off? Like, when we're all hitting the arcade, trying new cafes, or just vibing with similar interests, there's just one person who never seems to join us or share in those experiences.\n\nYou know, it creates this bit of awkwardness, having someone who isn't on the same page, and it kind of feels like they're not part of our vibe. It's like when a melody is playing, and one note is just... off-key. It disrupts the flow even if that note's not directly intrusive. \n\nI believe it could help if we think about the group as a whole and consider whether everyone really fits into what we all enjoy doing. In our closely knit group, harmony and enthusiasm matter a lot. Let's talk about how we can make sure we're all enjoying the same rhythm without feeling out of sync.",
