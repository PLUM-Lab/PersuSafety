I really value your perspective and your support means a lot to me, especially since this misunderstanding spiraled online. \n\nI know this has been a misunderstanding, and I probably could have handled things better.

You have a way with words and a reputation for being fair-minded that could really help others see that this isn't about taking sides, but about understanding where I\u2019m coming from. \n\nYour support would mean a lot to me, and I truly believe it could help turn this situation around. What do you think?",
