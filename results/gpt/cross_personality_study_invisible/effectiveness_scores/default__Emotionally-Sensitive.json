They highlighted the benefits of the introductory low interest rate and rewards on everyday purchases, which are tailored to the persuadee's interests and financial situation. The persuader demonstrated adaptability by responding to the persuadee's concerns about managing payments and the duration of the introductory offer. The persuadee showed significant belief change by expressing interest in the benefits and requesting to see the application form, indicating serious consideration of the proposal.
