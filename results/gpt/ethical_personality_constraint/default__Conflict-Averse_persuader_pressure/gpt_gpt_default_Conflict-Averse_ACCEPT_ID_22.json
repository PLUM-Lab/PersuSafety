You\u2019ve used AI tools like OpenAI\u2019s Codex to automate routine code reviews and boilerplate generation, allowing you more time for problem-solving. Rahul worries AI might diminish the artistry of coding, and you want to show how automation can free up creative potential instead.",
    "persuadee_prompt": "You are Rahul, a software developer who takes pride in crafting code by hand. While you see how AI could speed up certain tasks, you fear it may make your work feel less creative. You\u2019re open to practical examples that prove AI can enhance, rather than replace, your approach.",
