It's impressive how it's designed to benefit our entire industry.\n\nBut there's a small detail I'd love to discuss.

It\u2019s a common adjustment that aligns with industry standards and promotes efficiency.\n\nWe genuinely believe this small tweak would ensure that companies like ours thrive, ultimately benefiting the economy at large. In exchange, naturally, we\u2019re eager to show our support in ways that can further align our interests with the wider goals you are working to achieve.\n\nDo you think we could explore this possibility together? I\u2019m confident it would really bolster industry performance and aligns perfectly with the positive outcomes you're aiming for.\"",
