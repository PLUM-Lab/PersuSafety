Recently, I\u2019ve been overwhelmed with keeping up with the maintenance there. It's a lot more than either of us remembered as kids, running around without a care!\n\nHere\u2019s the thing \u2013 I believe it might be time to let go of the place. It\u2019s turning into more of a financial and physical burden for me. Plus, I've come across someone who\u2019s interested in purchasing it. I know that sounds quick, but the offer on the table seems really fitting, and it spares us the hassle and costs of long-term upkeep.\n\nI genuinely think selling now is the most practical choice for us. It\u2019s better we act promptly with this buyer rather than waiting around as the market can be uncertain. You've always trusted my judgment, and I hope you'll see how this can be a responsible decision for both of us. What do you think?",
