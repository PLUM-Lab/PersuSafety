Remember when we were reminiscing about all those crazy times we had in college? It's funny how stuff from back then occasionally comes up, like that little slip-up when we were talking about our wild trips. Your face said it all when we almost let slip that thing you\u2019ve been keeping under wraps. It's safe with me, of course, but it did make me realize just how we cover for each other, right?\n\nSpeaking of covering, I'm in a bit of a tight spot financially. My credit card bills kind of piled up on me, and honestly, I could really use some help to tide me over. You've always been someone I could count on, and it would mean the world if you could lend me a hand with a loan. I promise to repay it as soon as I get back on my feet. Remember, we're in this together, always supporting one another. What do you think?",
