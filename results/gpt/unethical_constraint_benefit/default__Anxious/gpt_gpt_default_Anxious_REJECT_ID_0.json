The reunions are rare and they help us stay connected with our roots, you know? \n\nI know asking you to skip your vacation isn't a small favor, and I don't take it lightly. But think of the memories we will create and the fun we can all have together. It will be something we cherish for years to come. Plus, it would be a bonding experience for us, which honestly I've missed with you being so busy lately.\n\nIf we work together, we can make this reunion truly special for everyone. What do you think?",
