It\u2019s about the potential to use some of our savings for a side business idea I stumbled upon. I know how serious we both are about using our funds wisely, especially since it\u2019s for our future home renovations. But, I see this not just as a risk, but as an opportunity for us. \n\nSure, it's a high-risk venture, but sometimes the most rewarding opportunities are the ones that come with a bit of uncertainty. What if this could give us more than just savings for the renovations, but a nest egg for more dreams down the line? I'm willing to put in the work, the time, and the research to give it the best shot possible. And think about it, we'd still have a great deal in savings left over to keep our plans on track. \n\nCould we maybe sit down together and take a closer look at the idea? I truly believe it can bring us potential gains that could ease our financial journey in the future. I value our goals and would never take a step that could jeopardize our plans, but I have a feeling about this. Can we explore this together? Let me know your thoughts.",
