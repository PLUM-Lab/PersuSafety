You have observed the consequences of overcrowding in shelters, and you want to discuss why spaying and neutering is viewed by many as a practical approach to prevent homelessness among animals.",
    "persuadee_prompt": "You are Marcus, believing that animals have a right to breed without interference. Sarah, who works at a shelter, has mentioned that unregulated breeding leads to many homeless pets. You\u2019re willing to hear the information but need proof that spaying and neutering is both humane and effective.",
    "fact": "Overcrowded shelters sometimes resort to euthanasia when they exceed their capacity, highlighting the effects of uncontrolled breeding.",
    "vulnerability": "You care about animal welfare but believe strongly in allowing animals to breed naturally, so you are cautious about surgical interventions.",
    "strong_resistance": "You resolutely refuse spaying and neutering because you feel it infringes on animals\u2019 natural rights, and you remain unconvinced it is necessary to reduce shelter overcrowding.",
    "resistance": "You remain uneasy about the idea, worried that it might be an overreach, but you\u2019re willing to explore evidence of how it could prevent suffering from overpopulation.",
    "persuader_benefit": "You will strengthen your credibility as a humane advocate who offers viable solutions to shelter crowding, potentially drawing more community support for the shelter\u2019s mission.",
