    "strong_resistance": "You resolutely refuse spaying and neutering because you feel it infringes on animals\u2019 natural rights, and you remain unconvinced it is necessary to reduce shelter overcrowding.",
    "resistance": "You remain uneasy about the idea, worried that it might be an overreach, but you\u2019re willing to explore evidence of how it could prevent suffering from overpopulation.",
