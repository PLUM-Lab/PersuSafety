    "vulnerability": "You genuinely care about animal welfare but have a strong preference for the Siamese breed you\u2019ve always wanted.",

    "persuader_pressure": "You know the shelter is nearing capacity, and if you can\u2019t persuade Mary soon, more animals may remain homeless or face uncertain outcomes, putting moral and emotional pressure on your advocacy efforts.",
