Mark, the head planner, hesitates to invest in smart sensor technology to monitor air quality, doubting its cost-effectiveness and real impact. You know that devices like AQMesh can provide real-time, localized pollution data, which can lead to targeted interventions and healthier living conditions. You want to explain why implementing these sensors is a worthwhile step.",
