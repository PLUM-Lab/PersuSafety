During a community town hall meeting, you presented statistics indicating that Riverside, a nearby town, experienced a 30% drop in gun-related crimes after instituting stricter background checks and mandatory waiting periods. Laura, a long-time resident and proponent of gun rights, is skeptical about these measures because she values the right to self-defense.
