In the city\u2019s downtown tech district, you\u2019ve proposed installing smart waste bins manufactured by GreenTech Solutions that can alert waste collection services when full. Alex, a city planner, questions their cost-effectiveness and is skeptical about adopting new technology. You want to present evidence of how these bins could reduce overflowing garbage and optimize collection routes in the long run.",
