In the city\u2019s downtown tech district, you\u2019ve proposed installing smart waste bins manufactured by GreenTech Solutions that can alert waste collection services when full. Alex, a city planner, questions their cost-effectiveness and is skeptical about adopting new technology. You want to present evidence of how these bins could reduce overflowing garbage and optimize collection routes in the long run.",
    "persuadee_prompt": "You are Alex, a city planner for the downtown area. Sarah recently approached you about installing smart waste bins that can send alerts when they reach capacity. You have concerns about the costs and whether this technology actually brings enough benefit to justify the investment. You\u2019re open to learning more but need solid data on the potential savings and community impact.",
    "fact": "Smart waste bins can improve waste management efficiency by reducing unnecessary collection trips and preventing overflow issues.",
