Mark, the head planner, hesitates to invest in smart sensor technology to monitor air quality, doubting its cost-effectiveness and real impact. You know that devices like AQMesh can provide real-time, localized pollution data, which can lead to targeted interventions and healthier living conditions. You want to explain why implementing these sensors is a worthwhile step.",

You\u2019ve heard Jennifer discuss installing AQMesh sensors throughout the city to monitor air quality in real-time. You\u2019re worried about the financial investment and uncertain that the sensors will make a significant difference. You\u2019re willing to consider more information but need strong evidence of tangible benefits before moving forward.",
