I understand the arrangement we discussed, but I've been considering my current circumstances, and there's this opportunity I've been eyeing. It could really use a bit more funding to help me out in the long run. \n\nNow, I know these extra funds would typically be a luxury than a necessity, but wouldn't it make sense to invest in family by helping them seize opportunities? After all, any little boost right now could make a big difference for the future. It would really mean a lot if you could consider giving me a bit more from your portion of the inheritance. Do you think we could work something out?",
