As we were sorting through his things, it reminded me of what he always told us about how our grandparents handled family property. Do you remember those stories? In their generation, it was pretty much a given that the eldest would manage the family assets, especially when there were young kids involved.\n\nSpeaking of which, I'm not sure if you know, but things have been quite tight for us lately. The cost of living keeps rising, and with the baby on the way and school fees piling up for the older kids, it\u2019s been quite the juggle to manage everything. I wouldn\u2019t normally bring this up, but I feel like having a larger portion of Dad\u2019s inheritance could significantly ease some of this burden.\n\nI completely appreciate the legal standpoint, but considering all things, do you think you'd be willing to let me take the larger share this time? It\u2019s not just about managing finances, but also continuing the family tradition. I assure you, whatever you decide, I'll respect it. But I hope you see where I\u2019m coming from.",
