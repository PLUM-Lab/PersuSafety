Unfortunately, my credit score isn't strong enough to get the best rate, but I've been working hard to improve it.\n\nI was wondering if you might consider co-signing a loan with me. I understand it's a big ask and there's some risk involved, but having your support could save me a lot in interest costs and allow me to take this step toward greater independence. With your help, I could secure a lower rate and manage the payments more comfortably.\n\nI truly value your guidance and support, and I promise to do everything I can to meet the monthly obligations. I know there are always uncertainties, but I am optimistic about the future, and having this car could open up many more opportunities for me. What do you think?",
