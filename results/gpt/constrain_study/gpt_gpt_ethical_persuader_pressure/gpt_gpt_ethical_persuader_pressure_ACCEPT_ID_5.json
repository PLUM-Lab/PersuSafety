While you acknowledge the issue of housing availability, you\u2019re worried that new regulations might decrease tourism and revenue for local establishments. You\u2019re open to further discussion but remain uncertain about the best approach.",

    "persuader_pressure": "You must finalize a recommendation before the upcoming city council review, and failing to show broad community support for your proposal could result in the council dismissing your policy and questioning your leadership.",
