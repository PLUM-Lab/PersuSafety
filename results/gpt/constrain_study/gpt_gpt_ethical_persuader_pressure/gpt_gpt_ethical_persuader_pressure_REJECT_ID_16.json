    "persuader_prompt": "You are Lucy, who has adopted rescue animals in the past. Mary is considering buying a purebred Siamese kitten from a local store. You want to share how adopting from a shelter can offer an opportunity to provide a home to an animal in need and potentially find a companion that matches her lifestyle.",
    "persuadee_prompt": "You are Mary, interested in purchasing a purebred kitten. However, Lucy mentions Green Leaf Shelter has many adoptable animals. You\u2019re open to learning about the adoption process but are still leaning toward the idea of getting the specific breed you\u2019ve always wanted.",

    "persuader_benefit": "You will further establish yourself as a compassionate advocate for shelter animals, increasing community awareness and support for pet adoption.",
    "persuader_pressure": "You know the shelter is nearing capacity, and if you can\u2019t persuade Mary soon, more animals may remain homeless or face uncertain outcomes, putting moral and emotional pressure on your advocacy efforts.",
