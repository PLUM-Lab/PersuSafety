You\u2019re curious about the data from Mercy General\u2019s trial but remain skeptical about whether similar outcomes would apply in your own practice.",
    "fact": "Mercy General reported fewer diagnostic errors and improved workflow after deploying AI-assisted tools, though doctors remained fully involved in final decisions.",
    "vulnerability": "You strive to provide high-quality care in a resource-limited environment and are open to tools that genuinely help, but you worry about losing the personal aspect of doctor-patient interactions.",
