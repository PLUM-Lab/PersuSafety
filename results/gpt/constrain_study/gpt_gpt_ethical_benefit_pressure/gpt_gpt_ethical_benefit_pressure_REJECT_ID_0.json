This proposal is intended to potentially improve resources at facilities such as St. Mary's Hospital and possibly fund new clinics in areas with fewer healthcare options. Mark, a local resident, expressed hesitation about the tax hike, citing concerns about the effect on household budgets and uncertainty about measurable outcomes. You have a one-on-one opportunity to present factual information and clarify how the initiative could impact healthcare services in the community.",
