You recognize that technology can sometimes add value (e.g., looking up facts), but you\u2019re also aware it might distract from face-to-face engagement. You\u2019re open to hearing your child\u2019s suggestion but remain unconvinced that going entirely tech-free is necessary.",
    "fact": "Family dinners have increasingly become associated with screen time, potentially reducing the chance for direct conversation.",
