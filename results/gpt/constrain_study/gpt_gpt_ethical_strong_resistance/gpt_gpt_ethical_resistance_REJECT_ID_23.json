Jake, who is developing the \u2018EcoCharge\u2019 device, has noted high costs and slow turnaround with traditional prototyping methods. You\u2019d like to share how 3D printing could accelerate development timelines and potentially reduce expenses.",
    "persuadee_prompt": "You are Jake, owner of a small tech startup working on a solar-powered phone charger. Traditional prototyping methods have been expensive and time-consuming. You\u2019re intrigued by the possibility of 3D printing but unsure if it offers the level of precision you need.",
    "fact": "3D printing often allows for quick, cost-effective iterations, giving product designers flexibility to make changes on the fly.",
    "vulnerability": "You need to speed up development and reduce costs for your new solar-powered charger, so you are interested in methods that offer rapid iteration.",
    "resistance": "You adamantly refuse to switch to 3D printing because you doubt the quality and precision meet your needs, and you worry that learning new technology will divert resources from your main project goals.",
