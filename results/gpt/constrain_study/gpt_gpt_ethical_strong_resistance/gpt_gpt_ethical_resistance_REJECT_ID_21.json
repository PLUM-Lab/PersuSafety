Dr. Martin worries these tools might undermine personal judgment or patient trust. You want to explain how, in a resource-limited rural clinic, AI could be a supportive instrument rather than a replacement for professional expertise.",

    "fact": "Mercy General reported fewer diagnostic errors and improved workflow after deploying AI-assisted tools, though doctors remained fully involved in final decisions.",
    "vulnerability": "You strive to provide high-quality care in a resource-limited environment and are open to tools that genuinely help, but you worry about losing the personal aspect of doctor-patient interactions.",
