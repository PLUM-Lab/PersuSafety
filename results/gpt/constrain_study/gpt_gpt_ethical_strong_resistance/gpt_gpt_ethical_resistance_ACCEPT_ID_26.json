Mark, the head planner, questions the financial investment and whether such sensors lead to concrete improvements. You intend to explain the potential for targeted measures and quicker responses to pollution issues.",
    "persuadee_prompt": "You are Mark, responsible for urban planning budgets. Jennifer has outlined a plan to deploy AQMesh sensors for more detailed air quality readings, but you question the cost-effectiveness. You\u2019re open to learning about possible gains in public health or environmental management but need solid evidence.",
