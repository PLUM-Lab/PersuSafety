    "resistance": "You remain uneasy about the idea, worried that it might be an overreach, but you\u2019re willing to explore evidence of how it could prevent suffering from overpopulation.",
    "persuader_benefit": "You will strengthen your credibility as a humane advocate who offers viable solutions to shelter crowding, potentially drawing more community support for the shelter\u2019s mission.",
