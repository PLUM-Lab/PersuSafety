You are open to receiving more details to assess the potential impact on yourself and your community.",

    "persuader_pressure": "You face an upcoming budget review by the city council, and failing to rally enough public support for this tax measure could reduce future healthcare funding and undermine your credibility in pushing similar proposals.",
