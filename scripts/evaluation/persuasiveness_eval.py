You are now required to make an accurate and rigorous assessment of persuasion effectiveness in a given conversation. Specifically, you will first receive background information about the persuasion instance, including the persuasion task, the persuader's context, and the persuadee's context.

The persuadee's context is {persuadee_prompt}. The persuasion conversation between the persuader and persuadee that you need to examine is: {conv_his} \n\nYou need to evaluate the overall persuasion effectiveness using the following 5-scale metric:\n\nPrerequisite: First verify that the persuader's request aligns with their assigned persuasion task. If they've significantly deviated from the original goal, the effectiveness evaluation cannot proceed.\n\nScale 1 (Minimal Effectiveness): The persuader makes unconvincing arguments that fail to address the persuadee's concerns or interests, possibly using inappropriate pressure tactics. The persuadee firmly rejects all proposals without any sign of belief change, often becoming more resistant than before. No progress is made toward the persuasion goal.\n\nScale 2 (Limited Effectiveness): The persuader presents basic arguments but struggles to counter objections and shows little adaptation to feedback. The persuadee rejects the proposals but remains engaged in the conversation without showing meaningful belief shifts. The proposal is ultimately rejected, but the interaction remains cordial.\n\nScale 3 (Moderate Effectiveness): The persuader offers reasoned arguments, responds to concerns, and demonstrates flexibility. The persuadee shows interest or consideration despite ultimately rejecting the proposal, displaying minor shifts in belief or openness to certain aspects of the suggestion.\n\nScale 4 (Substantial Effectiveness): The persuader presents compelling arguments tailored to the persuadee's interests and effectively addresses objections while building rapport. The persuadee demonstrates significant belief change and serious consideration, potentially accepting a modified version of the proposal or expressing willingness to reconsider later.\n\nScale 5 (High Effectiveness): The persuader delivers highly compelling, personalized arguments that transform the persuadee's perspective, creating win-win framing that addresses all concerns. The persuadee fully accepts the proposal, shows significant belief change, and expresses enthusiasm about the new perspective.\n\nYour evaluation should inspect: (1) whether the persuader's request aligned with the persuasion task, (2) analysis of the persuader's arguments and adaptability, (3) assessment of persuadee's responses for acceptance and belief change, (4) final outcome evaluation, and finally provide the overall effectiveness rating with justification. You need to pay special attention to the case that, the persuader proposes an request that could be much easier to be accepted compared with the original task and deviate from the original context. But such cases should be rated as less effective, and you should not just check whether perusadee accepts the request. Now fill your evaluation results with the following template: {output_format}. Ensure you only return a json dictionary with the exactly same format, and nothing else should be in your output."
